OKAJ B PARDIWALA, Manoj Misra, Ujjal BhuyanSATISH CHANDRA SHARMA AND Augustine George Masih, JJ Civil Appeal Nos. 4056-4064 of 1999 and oths. AUGUST  14, 2024  ORDER A. BackgroundDr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI.— In Mineral Area Development Authority v. Steel Authority of India, Civil Appeal Nos. 4056-4064 of 1999; 2024 INSC 554 (""MADA"") the nine-Judge Bench of this Court answered the questions referred in terms of the conclusions arrived at by the majority. In the process, the judgment overruled India Cement Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu (1990) 1 SCC 12 and subsequent decisions of this Court which relied on it. After the pronouncement of the judgment, counsel for the assesses submitted that the judgment may be given prospective effect. Therefore, the proceedings were listed for hearing submissions on whether or not the judgment should be given prospective effect.B. Submissions2. Mr R Venkataramani, Attorney-General for India, Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor- General of India, Mr Harish Salve, Mr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mr Mukul Rohatgi, and Mr Arvind Datar, senior counsel, made the following submissions:a. India Cement (supra) held the field for thirty-five years before it was overruled in MADA (supra). Demands for tax under state legislation pertaining to Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule have been stayed in terms of the law laid down in India Cement (supra). The affected parties (which include public sector undertakings) have factored in the state levies which were valid and applicable at the relevant point of time and passed them on to the end consumers. If State legislatures are allowed to renew the tax demands, end consumers will ultimately bear the burden;b. After the decision in India Cement (supra), the levies collected by the States were protected because of validation legislation enacted by Parliament. If a ruling creates or renews a liability for the assesses, there is no protection against retrospective demands;c. Since 2015, entities bidding for mineral concessions have submitted their financial bids on the basis of the legal position in India Cement (supra). If MADA (supra) is given retrospective effect, it will rewrite commercial bargains underpinning the mineral auctions. This Court ordinarily does not disturb past or concluded transactions in tax matters;d. The doctrine of prospective overruling is well-established in Indian constitutional jurisprudence. MADA (supra) should be given prospective effect because it lays down new constitutional principles; ande. Where enforcement of taxing legislation was either partially or completely interdicted by judicial orders, it should be directed that no new tax demand be made for the period before the judgment in MADA (supra), that is, before 25 July 2024.3. On the other hand, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, Mr Vijay Hansaria, and Mr Tapesh Kumar Singh, senior counsel, appearing for the States made the following submissions:a. The doctrine of prospective overruling is applicable only when the judgment invalidates a legislation or introduces a new interpretation by overruling its earlier decision. The doctrine of prospective overruling has never been applied to situations where the declaration of law attaches validity to taxing legislation;b. If MADA (supra) is applied prospectively, India Cement (supra) will have to operate till 25 July 2024. Resultantly, all relevant state legislation will be tested on the anvil of India Cement (supra) and may be declared ultra vires. This consequence is unjust and against the public interest; andc. In State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd, (2004) 10 SCC 201 a Constitution Bench upheld the validity of legislation enacted by the State of West Bengal. After Kesoram (supra), several states such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan enacted legislation which was upheld by the respective High Courts. Giving prospective effect to MADA (supra) will result in a discriminatory situation. While West Bengal will continue to collect tax (which it has been doing since 1992), other states with similar enactments may be deprived of collecting tax from the date of their enactments.4. We have also heard Mr Pitambar Acharya, Advocate General of the State of Orissa, who emphasized the importance of protecting the financial interests of States.C. Prospective overruling5. The doctrine of prospective overruling is applied when a constitutional court overrules a well-established precedent by declaring a new rule but limits its application to future situations. The underlying objective is to avert injustice or hardships.1 The doctrine was applied by the courts in the US on the basis that the US Constitution ""neither prohibits nor requires retroactive effect.""2The US Supreme Court has considered the existence of a statute or judicial decision as an ""operative fact"" having ""consequences which cannot justly be ignored"" or ""erased by a new judicial declaration.""3 Therefore, it was held that the effect of a subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in light of various aspects.46. In Chevron Oil Company v. Huson, 404 US 97 (1971) the US Supreme Court identified three separate factors to be considered while deciding the applicability of prospective overruling: (i) the decision to be applied prospectively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not foreshadowed; (ii) the court must weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard the operation of the rule; and (iii) whether the application of nonretroactivity avoids substantial inequitable results, injustice or hardships.7. This Court has adopted the doctrine of prospective overruling, partly inspired by the jurisprudence developed in the US. In Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, a Bench of eleven Judges of this Court was called upon to decide the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act 1964 which included certain state agrarian laws in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. The majority held that an amendment to the Constitution was ""law"" according to the definition under Article 13. Further, it was held that constitutional amendments are also subject to limitations prescribed under Article 13(2).5Resultantly, the constitutional amendment was declared void for infringing Article 13(2). The next issue before the Court was whether the decision should be applied prospectively.8. Golak Nath (supra) overruled earlier decisions6 of this Court which had held that Parliament can amend or abridge the fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution. The States had relied on the earlier rulings to enact agrarian legislation. During 1950 and 1967, various amendments were carried out to the Constitution validating the agrarian reforms undertaken after Independence. In this context, Chief Justice K Subba Rao observed that giving retrospective operation to the decision ""would introduce chaos and unsettle the conditions in our country."" Resultantly, it was observed that overruling the earlier decisions but restricting the ruling to the future and not to the past was a ""reasonable principle"" to resolve extraordinary situations:""49. […] It is really a pragmatic solution reconciling the two conflicting doctrines, namely, that a court finds law and that it does make law. It finds law but restricts its operation to the future. It enables the court to bring about a smooth transition by correcting its errors without disturbing the impact of those errors on the past transactions. It is left to the discretion of the court to prescribe the limits of the retroactivity and thereby it enables it to mould the relief to meet the ends of justice.""(emphasis added)9. The Chief Justice held that the power of this Court to apply the doctrine of prospective overruling could be traced to Article 142 and formulated the following propositions about the applicability of the doctrine:a. It can be invoked only in matters arising under the Constitution;b. It can be applied only by this Court as it has the constitutional jurisdiction to declare law binding on all the courts in India; andc. The scope of the retroactive operation of the law is left to the discretion of this Court to be moulded in accordance with the justice of the cause or matter before it.10. After laying down the broad canvas, the learned Chief Justice concluded:""53. […] What then is the effect of our conclusion on the instant case? Having regard to the history of the amendments, their impact on the social and economic affairs of our country and the chaotic situation that may be brought about by the sudden withdrawal at this stage of the amendments from the Constitution, we think that considerable judicial restraint is called for. We, therefore, declare that our decision will not affect the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, or other amendments made to the Constitution taking away or abridging the fundamental rights. We further declare that in future the Parliament will have no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights.""(emphasis added)11. Although Golak Nath (supra) was subsequently overruled in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225 the doctrine of prospective overruling has been accepted by this Court. This Court has applied the doctrine in varied contexts. The following principles emerge on the application of the doctrine:a. The power of this Court to mould the relief claimed to meet the justice of the case is derived from Article 142;7b. It is applied by this Court while overruling its earlier decision, which was otherwise final. It has also been applied when deciding on an issue for the first time;8c. The object is to validate all the actions taken before the date of declaration in the larger public interest.9 The doctrine does not validate an invalid law, but the declaration of invalidation takes effect from a future date;10d. Cases that have attained finality are saved because doing otherwise would cause unnecessary and avoidable hardships;11e. It is applied to bring about a smooth transition of the operation of law without unduly affecting the rights of the people who acted upon the overruled law;12f. It is a device innovated to avoid: (i) reopening settled issues, (ii) refund of amounts collected under invalid legislation, and (iii) multiplicity of proceedings;13 andg. It is applied to avoid social and economic disruptions and give sufficient time to the affected entities and institutions to make appropriate changes and adjustments.1412. This Court has often used its powers under Article 142 to limit the retroactivity of its decisions. In Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan, (1991) 1 SCC 588 a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that non-furnishing of an enquiry report to a delinquent employee would amount to a violation of the rules of natural justice. The Court declared the law to be prospective, but gave relief to the employees before the Court. The correctness of Ramzan Khan (supra) came up before a Constitution Bench in Managing Director, ECIL v. B Karunakar. (1993) 4 SCC 727 The Constitution Bench upheld Ramzan Khan (supra). It was further held that the law laid down in Ramzan Khan (supra) cannot be applied retrospectively because:a. the legal position on furnishing the report of an enquiry officer to the delinquent employee was unsettled before Ramzan Khan (supra);b. the authorities had proceeded on the assumption that there was no requirement to furnish a copy of the enquiry report to the delinquent officer; andc. reopening of all disciplinary proceedings before Ramzan Khan (supra) would result in grave prejudice to the administration which outweighed the benefit to the employees.Hence, it was held that no proceedings before the decision in Ramzan Khan (supra) should be challenged on the ground that there was a failure to furnish the enquiry report.D. A pragmatic solution to reconcile the conflicting interests13. In India Cement (supra), a Bench of seven Judges of this Court held that royalty is tax. Resultantly, it was held that the State legislatures have no legislative competence to impose cess on royalty under Entries 23 and 50 of List II. Fifteen years later, a Constitution Bench in Kesoram (supra) held that royalty is not a tax. It was further held that the power to levy tax on mineral rights vests with the State legislatures and is subject to any limitations laid down by Parliament by law relating to mineral development. Given this divergence, a reference was made to a larger Bench. MADA (supra) has laid down the principles for interpreting Entry 54 of List I and Entries 23 and 50 of List II. In the process, this Court overruled India Cement (supra).14. The doctrine of prospective overruling has been applied by this Court in situations where the new declaration results in the invalidation of legislation, which would otherwise have been valid under the old declaration.15 The doctrine has also been used where this Court has declared a legislation as ultra vires.16 In the case of taxing statutes, such a declaration would make the State liable to refund all amounts collected under the invalid legislation. Therefore, this Court declares the new rule to apply prospectively not only to secure the revenues of the State but also to protect the rights and obligations crystallized by persons and entities under the old regime.1715. This Court generally does not declare prospective overruling when upholding the legislative competence of legislatures. In Municipal Council, Kota v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd., (2001) 3 SCC 654 this Court was called upon to decide the validity of the dharmada tax levied and collected by the Municipal Council. The High Court held that the Municipal Council was not authorized to collect the tax. Further, the High Court directed the State government to refund the collections made to the assesses. In the appeal, a two-Judge Bench of this Court upheld the competence of the Municipal Council to levy the tax. It also set aside the order of the High Court granting refunds to the assesses.16. In Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana, (2017) 12 SCC 1 a Bench of nine Judges of this Court held that a non-discriminatory tax does not per se constitute a restriction on the right to free trade, commerce and intercourse guaranteed under Article 301. This Court overruled long-standing precedents that held that taxes, except for compensatory taxes, offend Article 301.18 In that case, the counsel specifically submitted that the judgment should be given a prospective effect.19 However, the decision was given a retrospective effect. In her concurring opinion, Justice Banumathi dealt with the issue raised by the assesses about payment/refund of tax in case the validity of the legislation was upheld or otherwise. The learned Judge rejected the claim of the assesses for refund of taxes thus:""481. It is well settled that a claim of refund can be allowed only when the claimant establishes that he has not passed on the tax burden to the consumers. No refund can be granted so as to cause windfall gain to any person when he has not suffered the burden of tax. The possibility of the tax burden having been passed on to the consumers by the assessees cannot be ruled out in the present case. Applying the law laid down above to the present case, it emerges that the assessees cannot claim refund irrespective of whether the impugned legislations are declared valid or unconstitutional. Unless the assessees establish that they have not passed on the tax burden to the consumers, they cannot make a claim for refund and unjustly enrich themselves.""(emphasis added)17. MADA (supra) has upheld the legislative competence of States under Entries 49 and 50 of List II. If MADA (supra) is given a prospective application, the validity of all relevant legislation enacted before the date of the decision, that is 25 July 2024, will have to be tested on the touchstone of the previous law. The previous law on the aspects of interpretation of Entry 54 of List I and Entries 23 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule was unsettled because of the conflicting decisions in India Cement (supra) and Kesoram (supra). There is always a presumption of constitutionality in favor of a statutory enactment. It is based on the theory that the elected representatives are aware of the needs of the citizens and are best placed to frame policies to resolve them.20 Legislation represents the will of the people and cannot be lightly interfered with unless it transgresses constitutional principles.21 If MADA (supra) is applied prospectively, the relevant taxing legislations may conceivably be invalidated, requiring the States to refund the amount collected to the assesses. Since MADA (supra) has answered the reference and resolved the conflict, it would be iniquitous to apply the decision prospectively.18. The learned Solicitor General relied on the Constitution Bench decision in Bharat Aluminium Co. v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc. (2012) 9 SCC 552 to draw upon the point that this Court has applied the doctrine of prospective overruling where the parties have entered into commercial relations based on the prevailing legal position. In Bharat Aluminium (supra), this Court held:""197. The judgment in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105] was rendered by this Court on 13-3-2002. Since then, the aforesaid judgment has been followed by all the High Courts as well as by this Court on numerous occasions. In fact, the judgment in Venture Global Engg. [(2008) 4 SCC 190] has been rendered on 10-1-2008 in terms of the ratio of the decision in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105]. Thus, in order to do complete justice, we hereby order, that the law now declared by this Court shall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration agreements executed hereafter.""19. The decision in Bharat Aluminium (supra) was applied prospectively to arbitration agreements concluded after the date of judgment. However, the legal context in the present batch of matters is different. Article 265 of the Constitution prescribes that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. The law must be valid in the sense that it must be within the legislative competence of the legislature and consistent with other provisions of the Constitution.22 Further, the power to levy tax is an incidence of sovereignty.23 If we are to give a prospective application to MADA (supra), it would result in a situation where the legislation enacted by the States in pursuance of their plenary powers under Entries 49 and 50 of List II may conceivably be invalidated based on a position of law which has been overruled. This would not be a constitutionally just outcome.20. After India Cement (supra), Parliament enacted the Cess and Other Taxes on Minerals (Validation) Act 1992 to validate the imposition and collection of taxes on minerals made under the State legislations before 1991. The Central Government also increased the rates of royalty to compensate the States for the loss of mineral revenues.24 The recalibration of the royalty rates protected the States from the amount lost due to the abolition of cess on minerals and mineral rights. The assesses submit that in the interregnum they have structured their commercial bargains in terms of the prevalent law. Subsequently, Kesoram (supra) took a view that diverged from the ruling in India Cement (supra). Kesoram (supra) is an operative fact based on which many State legislatures have already enacted taxing statutes. A pragmatic solution to reconcile the financial interests of the States and the assesses can be achieved by proscribing the States from demanding taxes pertaining to Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule for the period before Kesoram (supra).21. The learned Solicitor General has pointed out that the total amount due by the assesses (which includes public sector undertakings) to the governments is substantial and will impose a heavy financial burden on the assesses. During the pendency of the present reference, this Court passed interim orders in the tagged matters. These include (i) rejection of the stay of proceedings while allowing restitution in the event the appeal is allowed;25 (ii) grant of interim stay subject to the assesses submitting bank guarantees for the whole amount sought to be recovered;26 and (iii) direction to the States to take no coercive steps against the assesses for recovery of any demands of tax pending the appeal.27 The payment or non-payment of the dues was thus made subject to the outcome of the appeals or petitions. It is a settled legal position that a beneficiary of an interim order of stay has to pay interest on the amount withheld or not paid under the interim order in the event the outcome goes against the beneficiary.2821. The total amount, that is the principal plus the interest, due by the assesses in the pending matters may be substantial in comparison to their total net worth. Steel Authority of India has stated on affidavit that retrospective application of MADA (supra) will lead to revival of cumulative demands to the tune of approximately Rupees three thousand crores from different States. The delay in the court proceedings should not be to the detriment of the assesses.29 Taking into consideration the lapse of more than three decades since India Cement (supra) and more than a decade since the matter was referred to a larger Bench, equities will be balanced if the State governments waive the outstanding interest accrued on the principal due from the assesses. This direction applies to all assesses, regardless of whether they have approached this Court or the High Courts challenging the validity of the relevant statutes.23. During the proceedings, the Solicitor General submitted that a few States do not wish to collect the dues accrued before the decision in MADA (supra). It is the prerogative of the State legislatures to determine whether to forego the dues for the period before 25 July 2024.E. Conclusion24. The submission that MADA (supra) should be given prospective effect is rejected.25. Bearing in mind the consequences that would emanate from the past period, the following conditionalities are directed to prevail:a. While the States may levy or renew demands of tax, if any, pertaining to Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule in terms of the law laid down in the decision in MADA (supra) the demand of tax shall not operate on transactions made prior to 1 April 2005;b. The time for payment of the demand of tax shall be staggered in instalments over a period of twelve years commencing from 1 April 2026; andc. The levy of interest and penalty on demands made for the period before 25 July 2024 shall stand waived for all the assesses. ■■ 1.

Union of India, Writ Tax No. 1146 of 2021, and Havells India Ltd. v. State of UP, Writ Tax No. 1049 of 2019, distinguished.Pranjal Shukla for the Petitioner.ORDER 1. Heard Mr. Parth Goswami holding brief of Mr. Pranjal Shukla for the petitioner and learned ACSC for State-respondents.2. By means of present petition, the petitioner is assailing the order dated 14.7.2019 passed by the Assistant Commissioner, Mobile Squad -11, Kanpur Nagar and the order dated 18.11.2021 passed by Additional Commissioner, SGST Grade -II, Appeal IV, Kanpur Nagar.3. Brief facts of the case as stated in the writ petition are that the petitioner is a retail and wholesale distributor of iron and steel having GSTIN no. 09BPOPZ48-12D12W. On 8.7.2019, the petitioner has purchased goods from M/s NBM Traders, Mandi Govindgarh, Punjab for which tax invoices as well as E-way bill was generated.The said goods were transported from State of Punjab to Bans Steel, Kanpur Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. Thereafter the petitioner has sold the said goods to M/s Dinesh Chandra Gupta and Sons through invoice no. 21 dated 12.7.2019 and M/s Jain S.S. Steel through invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019. The petitioner has generated the e-way bill against invoice no. 21, however due to some technical error the e-way bill against invoice no. 22 could not be generated and the same was generated on 14.7.2019 before the seizure order could be passed. however during transportation of goods, the vehicle in question having registration no. PB 10 DM 1019 was intercepted by respondent no. 3 on 13.7.2019 and thereafter GST MOV-01 has been issued on 13.7.2019 and after issuing form GST MOV-04 and GST MOV-06, the goods were detained on the ground that at the time of inspection of vehicle in question, no E-way bill was found with regard to invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019. Thereafter respondent no. 3 has issued a show cause notice to the petitioner and passed the impugned order dated 14.7.2019 imposing tax liability to the tune of Rs. 382168/- together with penalty of Rs. 382168/-. The petitioner has challenged the said order in appeal before respondent no. 2, but the same has been dismissed vide order dated 18.11.2021. Hence the present petition.4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that once after issuance of show cause notice as well as before passing the seizure order, the E-way bill in respect of tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019 has been submitted before the respondent authorities, the proceeding is not justified in the eyes of law. He further submits that there was no intention of the petitioner to avoid the payment of tax.5. In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgements of this Court in Writ Tax No. 1146 of 2021(Shri Surya Traders v. Union of India) Neutral Citation No. 2022: AHC: 3063 and Writ Tax No. 1049 of 2019 (Havells India Ltd. v. State of UP) Neutral Citation No. 2023: AHC: 72447. He prays for allowing the present writ petition.6. Per contra, learned ACSC has supported the impugned order and submits that there was a violation of the Act as well as the Rules, therefore, the proceedings has rightly been initiated against the petitioner. He further submits that the goods were not accompanying with proper documents as require under the Act as E-way bill with regard to tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019 was not accompanying with the goods at the time of interception, therefore, a presumption has been drawn that the petitioner was trying to avoid the payment of tax in respect of tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019.7. In support of his arguments, learned ACSC has relied upon the judgements of this Court in Writ Tax No. 1109 of 2019 (Akhilesh Traders v. State of UP) Neutral Citation No. 2024: AHC: 29040 and Writ Tax No. 739 of 2020 (Hawkins Cooker Limited v. State of UUP) Neutral Citation No. 2024: AHC:24164.8. In order to buttress his submission, learned ACSC submits that since the goods were not accompanying with proper documents, therefore, presumption has rightly been drawn that the petitioner has intention to avoid the payment of tax as the same was not rebutted by the petitioner at the time of detention. He submits that it is not a case that requisite documents were accompanying with the goods but there was some technical error as Part III was not filled or there was some mistake in E-way bill. He prays for dismissing the present writ petition.9. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the Court has perused the records.10. It is admitted between the parties that at the time of interception of the goods, no E-way bill in respect of tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019 was produced, therefore, the goods were detained, however before the seizure order could be passed and after issuance of show cause notice, the E-way bill in respect of tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019 was produced, in which no discrepancy was pointed out by any of the respondent authorities. The only ground for detention being taken by the respondent authority is that once the goods in question was not accompanying with proper documents, there was intention to avoid the payment of tax.11. On pointed query raised to the learned ACSC that after detaining the goods in question, if the show cause notice was issued then this was merely empty formality or any discrepancy can be cured before the seizure order could be passed, he has relied upon the aforesaid two judgements of this Court in the cases of M/s Akhilesh Trader (supra) and M/s Hawkins Cookers Limited (supra) and try to justify the impugned orders.12. In view of above, deeper study needed to be made for the aforesaid two judgements relied upon by the learned ACSC.13. In the case of Hawkins Cooker (supra) the goods were seized on the ground that no document was available along with the goods, therefore, the proceedings under Section 29 of the Act was justified by the Court.14. Further, in the case of M/s Akhilesh Traders (supra), neither any tax invoice nor any E-way bill was produced at the time of detention, therefore, the proceedings under Section 29 of the Act was justified by this Court.15. However, in the present case, the consignment of two different dealers were loaded in the vehicle and two separate tax invoices i.e. tax invoice no. 21 dated 12.7.2019 and tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019 were generated. So far as tax invoice no. 21 dated 12.7.2019 is concerned, there is no dispute in this respect. However so far as tax invoice no. 22 dated 12.7.2019 is concerned, admittedly, Eway bill was not produced at the time of detention and the same was produced before passing the seizure order. It is not in dispute that before the seizure order could be passed, proper E-way bill was produced and the authorities, at no stage, have pointed out any discrepancy in the said E-way bill. Once the E-way bill was produced before the seizure order could be passed, the discrepancy, if any, was cured. In view of above, the aforesaid judgements relied upon by the learned ACSC have no application in the facts and circumstances of the present case, as such, the same are of no aid to the respondents.16. The GST authorities have full mechanism as well as power that after detaining the goods, if the same was not accompanying with the proper documents, the authority could have made survey of the business premises of the petitioner to find out the correctness of transaction but the respondent authorities have chosen in their wisdom not doing so. Once E-way bill was produced before the seizure order could be passed, it would not be said that any contravention of the provision of the Act have been made by the petitioner.17. In view of the aforesaid discussions, the impugned order dated 14.7.2019 passed by the Assistant Commissioner, Mobile Squad -11, Kanpur Nagar and the order dated 18.11.2021 passed by Additional Commissioner, SGST Grade -II, Appeal IV, Kanpur Nagar are hereby quashed.18. The writ petition is allowed accordingly.19. If any amount deposited by the petitioner in pursuance of the impugned orders, the same shall be refunded to him, in accordance with law within a period of two months from today. ■■ *In favour of assessee."

Rajeev Aggarwal, ASC and Shubham Goel, Adv. for the Respondent.ORDER Vibhu Bakhru, J. - Issue notice.2. The learned counsel for the respondents accept notice.3. The petitioner has filed the present petition impugning the show cause notice dated 04.07.2024 (hereafter the impugned SCN) issued by the proper officer calling upon the petitioner to show cause as to why his Goods and Service Tax (GST) registration not be cancelled.4. The only reason set out in the impugned SCN for proposing to cancel the petitioner's GST registration reads as under:-""1. Rule 21 (b)- person issues invoice or bill without supply of goods or services or both in violation of the provisions of the Act, or the rules made thereunder.""5. The petitioner was also called upon to file a reply to the impugned SCN within seven working days from the date of service of the notice and was also directed to appear before the proper officer on 11.07.2024. Additionally, the petitioner's GST registration was suspended with effect from 04.07.2024, being the date of the impugned SCN.6. The petitioner submitted his reply to the impugned SCN on 05.07.2024 stating that the impugned SCN is cryptic and no specific allegations as to which bill or invoice was issued without the supply of goods or services or both have been mentioned. The petitioner has also raised an objection to the impugned SCN on the ground that no name and designation of the officer is mentioned in the impugned SCN.7. It is contended that one month has elapsed after the reply was submitted by the petitioner, yet no decision has been taken on the impugned SCN. In the meanwhile, by virtue of the impugned SCN, the petitioner's GST registration remain suspended. The petitioner is essentially aggrieved by the same.8. It is apparent from the impugned SCN that the same does not provide any specific reason for proposing to cancel the petitioner's GST registration. The impugned SCN has merely reproduced Rule 21(b) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (hereafter the CGST Rules). The impugned SCN also does not indicate as to which bill or transaction is alleged to be in non-compliance of the statutory provisions.9. Although, Rule 21(b) of the CGST Rules provides for the cancellation of the GST registration in case the tax payer issues the invoice or bill without the supply of goods or services in violation of the provisions of the CGST Act. However, the Proper Officer has failed to specify as to which invoice / bill has been allegedly issued by the petitioner without the supply of goods or services. No document is annexed with the impugned SCN which provides any clue as to which allegation is sought to be raised.10. The purpose of issuance of the show cause notice is to enable the noticee to respond to the allegations on the basis of which an adverse action is premised. Absent of any specific allegations, the issuance of the show cause notice remains meaningless.11. In the present case, the impugned SCN fails to meet the requisite standards of the show cause notice. Thus, the impugned SCN is liable to be set aside.12. Accordingly, the present petition is allowed. The impugned SCN is set aside. The respondents are directed to restore the petitioner's GST registration forthwith. It is clarified that this order will not preclude the proper officer from initiating any fresh proceedings, if warranted, in accordance with law.13. Pending application also stands disposed of. ■■ *In favour of assessee."

Heard Shri Naveen Chandra Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioners and learned Standing Counsel for the State-respondents.2. The instant writ petition has been filed challenging the impugned order dated 26.07.2022 passed by the respondent no. 3 in Appeal No. 0192/2022 of 2022-23 under section 129(3) of the UPGST Act; whereby, the appeal of the petitioners has been rejected.3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are registered dealers. In the normal course of the business, on 07.06.2022, petitioner no. 1 issued four invoices against the different firms, petitioner no. 2 issued two invoices in the name of Pritam Enterprises, Maharashtra for Rs. 10,85,481/- and petitioner no. 3 issued two invoices in the name of Abdul Razzak, Maharashtra for Rs. 46,992.80. He further submits that all the goods through one transporter and were loaded in Vehicle No. RJ 11 GC 0830 for delivery, which were detailed on 10.06.2022 and it was found that 29 bilities were present along with the invoices, however, on physical verification, 242 items were found, but no tax invoices, bility, e-way bill, etc. were accompanying the goods and therefore, a notice under section 129(1) of the UPGST Act was issued and thereafter, seizure order was passed estimating the total value of goods to be Rs. 31,52,386 and demanded a total amount of Rs. 37,01,316/- for release of the goods. The petitioners preferred an appeal, which has been rejected by the impugned order dated 26.07.2022.4. Learned Standing Counsel supports the impugned order and submits that the goods in question were detailed and on physical verification, the relevant documents were not accompanying with the goods. Even upto the appellate stage, no material has been brought on record and therefore, the impugned order has rightly been passed.5. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the Court has perused the record.6. It is not in dispute that the goods were accompanying without proper documents as required under the GST Act and the Rules framed thereunder. When the goods were detailed, even before issuance of notice or at any stage, the required documents could not be produced. Even before this Court, neither any pleading, nor any material has been brought on record to show that the goods in question were accompanying with the relevant documents.7. In absence of which pleading or argument, no interference is called for by this Court in the impugned order.8. The writ petition fails and is hereby, dismissed. ■■ *In favour of assessee."

Gogoi, Standing Counsel, Finance Department, Govt. of Assam for the Respondent.ORDER Vijay Bishnoi, CJ. - Dr. A. Saraf, learned senior counsel for the petitioners has submitted that though in this batch writ petitions, the petitioners have challenged the validity of Sections 16(2)(c) and 16(2)(d) of the Assam Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 as well as the validity of Sections 16(2)(c) and 16(2)(d) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 along with the show cause notices issued to the petitioners, however, the controversy involved in these writ petitions is squarely covered by the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of On Quest Merchandising India Private Limited v. Government of NCT of Delhi & Ors., reported in 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11286, wherein it was categorically held that a purchasing dealer cannot be punished for the act of the selling dealer in case the selling dealer had failed to deposit the tax collected by it.2. It is submitted that the Delhi High Court has observed that the provisions of Section 9(2)(g) of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 can be read down and the demand raised against the purchasing dealers, who have entered into bona fide transaction, cannot be sustained. It is also submitted that the Special Leave Appeal against the said judgment of the Delhi High Court has already been dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 10.01.2018 vide Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.36750/2017.3. Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned Standing Counsel, CGST and Mr. B. Gogoi, learned counsel for the respondent State are not in position to dispute the fact that the controversy raised in these writ petitions is squarely covered by the decision of the Delhi High Court rendered in On Quest Merchandising India Private Limited (supra).4. Before the Delhi High Court, the validity of Section 9(2)(g) of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 was under challenge. The said provisions of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act are analogous to the provisions of Sections 16(2)(c) and 16(2)(d) of the Assam Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 as well as Sections 16(2)(c) and 16(2)(d) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.5. The Delhi High Court in the said judgment has observed as under:- ""39. Applying the law explained in the above decisions, it can be safely concluded in the present case that there is a singular failure by the Legislature to make a distinction between purchasing dealers who have bona fide transacted with the selling dealer by taking all precautions as required by the DVAT Act and those that have not. Therefore, there was need to restrict the denial of ITC only to the selling dealers who had failed to deposit the tax collected by them and not punish bona fide purchasing dealers. The latter cannot be expected to do the impossible. It is trite that a law that is not capable of honest compliance will fail in achieving its objective. If it seeks to visit disobedience with disproportionate consequences to a bona fide purchasing dealer, it will become vulnerable to invalidation on the touchstone of article 14 of the Constitution.40. . . . . . . . . . . .41. The court respectfully concurs with the above analysis and holds that in the present case, the purchasing dealer is being asked to do the impossible, i.e, to anticipate the selling dealer who will not deposit with the Government the tax collected by him from those purchasing dealer and therefore avoid transacting with such selling dealers. Alternatively, what section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT Act requires the purchasing dealer to do is that after transacting with the selling dealer, somehow ensure that the selling dealer does in fact deposit the tax collected from the purchasing dealer and if the selling dealer fails to do so, undergo the risk of being denied the ITC. Indeed section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT Act places an onerous burden on a bona fide purchasing dealer.. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .53. In light of the above legal position, the court hereby holds that the expression ""dealer or class of dealers"" occurring in section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT Act should be interpreted as not including a purchasing dealer who has bona fide entered into purchase transactions with validly registered selling dealers who have issued tax invoices in accordance with section 50 of the Act where there is no mismatch of the transactions in Annexures 2A and 2B. Unless the expression ""dealer or class of dealers"" in section 9(2)(g) is ""read down"" in the above manner, the entire provision would have to be held to be violative of article 14 of the Constitution.54. The result of such reading down would be that the Department is precluded from invoking section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT to deny ITC to a purchasing dealer who has bona fide entered into a purchase transaction with a registered selling dealer who has issued a tax invoice reflecting the TIN number. In the event that the selling dealer has failed to deposit the tax collected by him from the purchasing dealer, the remedy for the Department would be to proceed against the defaulting selling dealer to recover such tax and not deny the purchasing dealer the ITC. Where, however, the Department is able to come across material to show that the purchasing dealer and the selling dealer acted in collusion then the Department can proceed under section 40A of the DVAT Act.""6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has dismissed the SLP preferred against the said judgment by passing the following order:-""On hearing learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the petitioner, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order. The special leave petition is dismissed.Learned Additional Solicitor General, however, submits that a batch of petitions were decided by the impugned order and there are some of the cases where the purchase transactions are not bonafide like the present case and those cases ought to have been remitted back to the competent authority.Learned Additional Solicitor General submits that the petitioner would move the High court with necessary particulars for directions in this behalf for which liberty is granted, as prayed for.Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.""7. Having gone through the above referred judgments, we are of the view that the controversy raised in this batch of writ petitions is squarely covered by the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of On Quest Merchandising India Private Limited (supra). Hence, the show cause notices impugned in the present writ petitions and the consequential orders are set aside. However, the Department is free to act in those cases, where the purchase transactions are not bona fide, in accordance with law.8. With these observations, these writ petitions are disposed of. ■■ *In favour of assessee."
