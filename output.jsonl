Durga  Prasad Rao, J. - In this Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the\npetitioner seeks the following relief:\n\"to issue Wirt of Mandamus or any other appropriate Writ or Order or Direction declaring the action of\nthe 2nd Respondent  in passing Order dated 10-7-2023 having reference DIN3 716052321888/2017-18,\nDIN No. 3716052352492/2018-19, DIN 3716052394469/2019-20, DIN 3716052381053/2020-21\ndirecting payment of tax of Rs. 65,40,840/-, penalty of Rs. 65,40,840/- and interest of Rs. 45,48,892/-\ntotaling to Rs. 1,76,30,572/-, for the tax period 2017-18 to 2020-21, under the CGST/SGST Acts, 2017,\nas arbitrary , contrary to law, without jurisdiction and in violation of Principles of Natural Justice, and\nconsequently  set aside  the proce edings of the 2nd respondent dated 10-7-2023 and pass such other order\nor orders as the Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the circumstance of the case.\"\n2. The petitioner's grievance is that she is the owner of the Godown No. 02, having total capacity of 10000\nMts situat ed at M/s Jagadish & Others Warehouses , Bhanupr akash Nagar , Sitarampet Village, Yerpedu\nMandal, Chittoor District. The said godown was used to provide services  of storage and warehousing to\nclients such as Andhra Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (APSCSCL). The petitioner received\nmonitory consideration as per the agreement for the period between 2017 and 2021 a sum of Rs.\n3,59,70,000/-. Later the Regional Vigilance and Enforcement Officer inspected his warehouse  and therea fter a\nshow cause notice was issued to the petitioner on 4-2-2022 stating that the services  provided by the petitioner\namounts to renting of immovable property and therefore the same is not exempted from tax. The petitioner\nfiled objec tions contending that the services  of storage and ware housing of food grains is exempted from levy\nof tax as per Notification No. 12/2017 - Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017. The activity undertaken by the\npetitioner is that it had entered into an agreement with APSCSCL for providing storage, warehousing services\ninvolving loading, unloading, stacking, packing, care, custody and security etc., of food grains and the activity\nof storage or warehousing of rice is specifically covered under entries prescribed in Sl.No.24 and also under\nSl.No.3 or Sl.No.54 of Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017 and it is exempted from\npayment of tax. However , without considering the reply of the petitioner in proper manner , the 2nd respondent\nheld that the petition er has let out 10000 Mts of space on monthly rental basis and delivered possession and\ntherefore the said activity attracts tax @ 9% under SGST & CGST as prescri bed in Entry No. 997212 and\ndisagreed with the contention of the petitioner that the services  rendered by the petitioner are exempted under\nNotification No12/2017 - Central T ax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017.\n(a) It is the case of the petitioner that under Notification No. 12/2017, all the services  related to supplies like\nloading, unloading, storage or warehousing including those of renting and leasing is exempted from tax if\nsuch supplies are made to the Gover nment or Government Authority . The APSCSCL is apparently a\nGovernment Authority as the Government holds more than 90% on equity shares and therefore, the\ntransaction exempted from tax.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. The 2nd responden t not filed counter . Learned Government Pleader submitted that he filed counter in\nsimilar connected Writ Petition No. 21055 of 2023 and since the factual and legal aspects in both the matters\nare same, the counter averments in W .P.No.21055/2023 may be considered in the present writ petition also.\n4. Heard Sri Shaik Jeelani Basha, learned counsel for the petitioner and learn ed Government Pleader for\nCommercial T axes-II representing respondents.\n5. While learned counsel for the petitioner Sri Shaik Jeelani Basha reiterated his pleadings in his argument,\nlearned Government Pleader took a fundamental objection regarding the entertainability of the writ petition on\nthe ground that the petitioner has an efficacious and alternative remedy of appeal and therefore the writ\npetition is not maintainable. He placed reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in Assistant\nCommissioner (CT)  (LTU), Kakinada  v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. [2020 SCC OnLine\nSC 440 = (2020) 19 SCC 681/[2020] 1 16 taxmann.com 417/2020 (36) G.S.T .L. 305]\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow ?\n7. POINT :- We gave our anxious consideration to the above respective submissions, particularly the\npreliminary objection of learned Government Pleader regarding the entertainability of the writ petition.\nAdmittedly , the petitioner has an efficacious and alternative remedy to file appeal. The said fact is alsoAJAYmentioned in the impugned order to the effect that an appeal lies against the impugned order before the\nAppellate Joint Commissioner (ST), T irupathi.\n8. In that view of the matter and also in view of the decision in Assistant Commissioner (CT), Kakinada  v.\nGlaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd's case (Supra 1) wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the\nHigh Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition when an efficacious and alternative remedy of\nappeal is available to the petitioner , without expressing our opinion on the merits of the petitioner's case, we\ndeem it apposite to give liberty to the petitioner to file an appeal against the impugned order .\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is disposed of giving liberty to the petitioner to file an appeal against the\nimpugned order dated 10-7-2023 passe d by the 2nd respondent before the concerned Appellate Authority\nwithin four (4) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order , in which case, the Appellate Authority\nshall admi t the appeal and after affordin g an opportunity of hearing to both parties, pass an appropriate order\non merits in accordance with governing law and rules expeditiously . Till the time granted for filing of appeal\nis over, the respondent authorities shall not take any coercive action against the petitioner for recovery of\ndemanded tax under the impugned order . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending if any shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The challenge in this writ petition is to the endorsement in Special Appeal No.\nGST/ELR/133/2021-22, dt.09-9-2022 passed by the 1st respondent rejecting the appeal filed by the petitioner\nagainst the Assessment Order dated 2-1-2022 passed by the 2nd respondent.\n2. Hear d learned counsel Sri Anil Bezawada representing Sri Varun Byreddy , learned counsel for petitioner\nand learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax-I for respondents.\n3. As can be seen from the impugned endorsement, the main reasons for rejection of appeal are:\n(i) that the original Assessment Order dated 2-1-2022 was duly served on the same date, but the appeal\nwas filed in manual form on 28-2-2022 and later e-appeal was filed on 1-9-2022  with a delay of six\nmonths.\n(ii) the pre-requisite deposit of 10% of the disputed tax has not been paid.\n On the above two main grounds the appeal was rejected.\n4. Learned counsel for petitioner with regard to the first ground of rejection would submit that the petitioner\nhas received the Assessment Order on 2-1-2022 itself, but as immediately the Assessment Order was not\nuploaded on the official website, he could not present the appeal in electronic form and thereby following\nRule 108 of CGST Rules, he preferred the appeal in manual form on 28-2- 2022. He further submit thatsubsequently the petitioner received notice  vide GST Spl.No.ELR/1 33/2021-22, dated 16-8-2022 from 1st\nrespondent informing him that, since the e-appeal was not filed and only phys ical copies of the appeal were\nfiled the petitioner should appear before the 1st respondent on 27-8-2022. Learned counsel would submit that\nsince the said notic e was received by him subsequent to the date of hearing, the petitioner submitted his\ndetailed representat ion dated 6-9-2022 mentioning that the petitioner has filed the appeal (e-appeal)\nelectronically on 1-9-2022 since in the interregnum, the Assessment Order dated 2-1-2022 was uploaded on\nthe of ficial website and requested to consider the e-appeal.\n(a) Learned counsel would submit that since in the above circumstances delay was occurred in filing\nthe appeal in electronic form the 1st respondent ought to have taken into consideration the facts and\ncircumstances and admitted the appeal as there was no wilful delay on the part of the petitioner in\nfiling the appeal in electronic form.\n5. With regard to the second ground, learned counsel would submit that at the time of filing the appeal in\nmanual form, the petitioner has deposit ed 10% of the demanded tax vide e-challan in Form GST DRC-03,\ndated 25-2-2022 and mentioned the said fact in Column No. 13 under the caption 'pre-deposited challan' in the\nappeal proforma.\n6. Learned Government Pleader opposed the writ petition stating that the petitioner has not complied with the\ndirection of filing the appeal in e-form within time and therefore, the writ petition may be dismissed.\n7. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow?\n8. Point: As against the first ground of dismissal, the submission of learned coun sel for petitioner is that, the\nAssessment Order dated 2-1-2022 was not uploaded on the official website immediately and therefore, he was\nconstrained to file the appeal in manual form on 28-2-2022. The factum of non-uploading of the Assessment\nOrder dated 2-1-202 2 on official websit e is not disputed. In that view , the reason given by the petitioner for\nfiling the appeal in manual form can be accepted. Subsequently , a notice was issued on 16-8-2022 by the 1st\nrespondent directing the petitioner to appear before him on 27-8-2022 and the petitioner submitted a detailed\nrepresentation dated  6-9-2022 stating that in interregnum period the Assessment Order was uploaded on the\nofficial website and the appeal in electr onic form was filed on 1-9-2022. This explanation also seems to be\nplausible as subsequently the copy of the Assessment Order was uploaded and thereby the petitioner has filed\ne-appeal.\n9. The Division Bench of this Court in W.P.No.3308/2021 observed that manual form of filing appeal is\npermissible in terms of Rule 108(1) of APGST Rules 2017. The conspectus of the facts and law shows that\nthe explanation offered by the petitioner against the first ground of dismissal as plausible and tenable. So far\nas, the second ground of rejection is concerned a perusal of copy of the challan filed along with material\npapers shows that the petitioner made a pre-deposit of 10% of the demanded tax on 25-2-2022 i.e., at the time\nof manual filing of the appeal. Therefore, it can be said that the said requirement was also complied.\n10. Thus on a conspect us, in our view , the 1st respondent ought to have admitted the appeal filed in electronic\nform instead of rejecting the same under the impugned endorsement.\n11. Accordingly , this writ petition is allowed and the impugned endorsement dated 9-9-2022 passed by the 1st\nrespondent is  set aside  with a direction to the 1st respondent to register the appeal and dispose of the same in\naccordance with governing law and rules after affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner\nexpeditiously . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n\u25a0\u25a0"}

Sesh a Sai, J. - Heard Sri Karan  Talwar , learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri J.Naga Bhushan,\nlearned Additional Advocate General-I I for the respondents, apart from perusing the material available on\nrecord.\n2. The order of assessment bearing Ref. No. ZD370321001535W , dated 17-3-2021, confirming the tax\ndemand of Rs. 57,43,679/- and equal penalty and interest for the period from  July, 2017 to March, 2018,\npassed by 1st respondent herein, is under challenge in the present W rit Petition.\n3. The Asse ssing Authority-1st respondent herein issued a revised show cause notice dated 20-1-2021 under\nsection 73 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, 'the CGST Act, 2017') read with rule\n142(1) of the Central Goods and Services T ax Rules, 2017.\n4. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner , the impugned order of assessment passed by 1st\nrespondent is liable to be set aside on the sole ground of non-compliance of mandatory provisions of sub-\nsection (4) of section 75 of the CGST Act, 2017.S.K. JAIN5. On the other hand, it is vehemently contended by the learned Additional Advocate General-II, representing\nthe respondents, that having failed to respond to the show-cause notice dated 20-1-2021, it is not open for the\npetitioner herein to raise any objection as to the impugned order of assessment. It is also the submission of the\nlearned Additional Advocate General-I I that only after affording full-fledged  opportunity to the petitioner\nherein, 1st responde nt-Assessing Authority passed the impugned order of asses sment on 17-3-2021. It is the\nfurther submission of the learned Additional Advocate General-II that in view of availability of alternative\nremedy of appeal under section 107 of the CGST Act, 2017 before the Appellat e Authority , this Writ Petition\nis not maintainable before this Court.\n6. During the course of arguments, it is brought to the notice of this Court by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the petitioner could not file objections to the show-cause notice within the time stipulated due\nto certain reasons as mentioned in the writ affidavit, but written objections were filed on 18-3-2021. Though a\nnumber of reasons have been pleaded in the writ affidavit for non-filing of the reply to the show-cause notice\nwithin the time stipulated, this Court does not propose to go into the said aspect  having regard to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\n7. In order to adjudic ate the issue on hand, this Court feels it appropriate to refer to the provisions of the\nCGST Act, 2017. Chapter XV of the Act deals with 'Demands and Recovery'. Section 73 of the Act deals with\n'Determination of tax not paid or short paid or erroneously refunded or input tax credit wrongly availed or\nutilized for any reason other than fraud or any willful misstatement or suppress ion of facts'. Section 74 of the\nAct deals with 'Determination of tax not paid or short paid or erroneously refund ed or input tax credit wrongly\navailed or utilized for any reason of fraud or any willful misstatement or suppression of facts'. Section 75 of\nthe Act deals with 'General provisions relating to determination of tax'. The provision of law which is\ngermane and relevant for the purpose of adjudication of the issue in the present Writ Petition is sub-section (4)\nof section 75 of the Act, which reads as under:\n\"An opportunity of hearing shall be granted where a request is received in writing from the person\nchargeable with tax or penalty , or where any adverse decision is contemplated against such person.\"\nIt is very much evident from a reading of the above provision of law that opportunity of hearing is required to\nbe granted  where a request is received in writing from the person chargeable with tax or penalty , or where any\nadverse decision is contemplated against such person. It is also evident from the above provision of law that\nwhen an adverse decision is contempla ted against any assessee, opportunity of hearing to such assessee is\nindispensable and is required to be followed scrupulously .\n8. In the instant case, admittedly , proposin g an adverse action, by way of a show cause notice, 1st respondent\ninitiated action under the above provision of law. It is evident from a reading of the impugned order that on\nthe ground  that the petitioner herein failed to respond to the show cause notice by way of filing objections, 1st\nrespondent herein confirmed the demand. When such a course of action is adopted by 1st respondent herein\nprejudicial to the interest of the assessee, the mandatory requirements of law as provided under sub-section (4)\nof section 75 of the CGST Act, 2017 are required to be followed scrupulously . Therefore, the impugned order ,\nin the considered opinion of this Court, is liable to be set aside not only on the ground of deviation from the\nmandatory provisions under sub-section (4) of section 75 of the CGST Act, 2017 but also on the ground of\nviolation of principles of natural justice. As such, the contention of the learned Additional Advocate General-\nII as regards the availability of alternative remedy of appeal under section 107 of the CGST Act, 2017, is\nliable to be rejected and is, accordingly , rejected.\n9. For the aforesaid reasons, the Writ Petition is allowed, setting aside the order of assessment bearing Ref.\nNo. ZD37 0321001535W , dated 17-3-2021 passed by the 1st respondent herein , and remanding the matter to\n1st respondent for consideration of the issue and for passing appropriate orders afresh after giving notice of\nhearing to the petitio ner indicating the date and time of personal hearing. It is made clear that on the date so\nfixed in the notice of personal hearing, the petitioner or its authorized represe ntative should necessarily be\npresent before 1st respondent for personal hearing without fail. It is also made clear that the objections dated\n18-3-2021 said to have been filed by the petitioner herein shall be taken into consideration while passing the\norder of assessment.\nThere shall be no order as to costs of the W rit Petition.\nMiscellaneous Petitions pending, if any , in the W rit Petition shall stand closed."}

Shivaji , Adv . for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The challenge in this writ petition is to the notice under section 70 (1) of GST\nAct, 2017 issued by the 3rd respondent to M/s. Sterlight technologies limited, Vishakapatnam who are the\ncustomers of the petitioner .\n2. Heard learned counsel for petitioner Mr. G.V.Shivaji and learned Government Pleader for Commercial\nTaxes II.\n3. The grievance of the petitioner as ventilated by learned counsel is that though  the 3rd respondent in terms\nof section 70 (1) of G.S.T Act, has power to summon any person whose attendance is considered necessary\neither for giving evidence or producing a document or any other thing in any inquiry in the same manner ,\nhowever that power is not extended to direct the summoning of a party to stop all further payments, which he\nought to receive from the customers. Learned counsel would submit in notice such a direction is contained\nwhich is beyond the jurisdiction of the 3rd respondent. He would thus pray to allow the writ petition and\ndelete the last paragraph in the impugned notice.\n4. Learned Government Pleader while admitting that in a notice issued under section 70 (1) of GST Act, the\nconcerned officer may not have power to issue a direction to stop payment by the summoning party to the\nassessee, would however argue, he has such power under section 83 of GST Act which deals with provisional\nattachment of any property or bank account of the assessee.5. As can be seen, the impugned notice was issued under section 70(1) of GST Act but not under section 83 of\nGST Act. Section 70 (1) of GST act only says that the proper officer shall have the power to summon any\nperson whose attendance is considered necessary either to give evidence or to produce a document or any\nother thing in the enquiry and nothing more. Therefore, it is obvious that under section 70 (1) of GST Act the\nproper officer cannot exercise powers to direct the summoning party to stop payment to the assessee which is\nbeyond the scope of 70 (1) of GST Act. Of course, under Section 83 of GST Act, if the Commissioner is of\nthe opinion that for the purpose of protecting the government revenue, he may by order provisional\nattachment of any property including bank account belonging to the taxed person or any person specified in\nsub-section 1 (A) of section 122 in such manner as prescribed. The impugned notice was issued under section\n70 (1) of GST Act but not in exercise of powers conferred under section 83 of GST Act. Thus at the outset, it\nis clear that the 3rd respondent has exceeded his power in directing M/s. Sterlight Technologies Limited to\nstop further payments to the petitioner herein. Therefore, such a direction is beyond the jurisdiction of the 3rd\nrespondent. The same is liable to be set aside to that extent.\n6. Accordingly , this writ petition is allowed and the impugned portion of the notice issued under section 70 (1)\nof GST Act i.e., \"in view  of the above explanation you are hereby requested stop all further payments from\nhere onwards until clearance is given by the undersigned\" is set aside and liberty is given to the 3rd\nrespondent to proceed in accordance with law so far as the other part of the notice issued by him under section\n70 (1) of GST Act is concerned.

By filing this petiti on under Article 226 of the Constitution of India petitioner seeks quashing of the order\ndated 22.09.2021 passed by respondent No.1-Superintendent of Central T ax cancelling GST registration of the\npetitioner as well as the order -in-appeal  dated 16.11.2022 passed by respondent No.2- Joint Commissioner\n(Appeals -I).\n3. Petitioner is a municipal body having jurisdiction over Naayanpet District, Telangana. It is registered with\nthe Goods  and Services Tax (GST) authorities  in the State of Telangana. By the order dated 22.09.2021,\nrespondent No.1 cancelled registration  of the petitioner under GST. Against this order of cancellation,KEW ALpetitioner preferred appeal  before respondent No.2 assailing the legality and validity of the order dated\n22.09.2021. By the order dated 16.11.2022, respondent No.2 as the appellate  authority  has held that the appeal\nwas filed beyond the period of extended limitation. Accordingly , the appeal  was dismissed.\n4. Hence, the writ petition.\n5. On a query by the Court as to why petitioner has not approached the Goods  and Services Tax Tribunal\n(GST Tribunal) under Section 112 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (briefly , 'CGST Act'\nhereinafter), learned counsel for the petitioner submits that till date no GST T ribunal has been constituted.\n6. We have perused the order dated 16.11.2022. This is an order passed by the first appellate  authority  under\nSection 107(1) of the CGST Act. As per subsection (1) of Section 107 of the CGST Act, limitation for filing\nappeal  is three months from  the date of communication of the order appealed  against. Under subsection (4) of\nSection 107 of the CGST Act, the appellate  authority  may allow the appeal  to be presented within a further\nperiod of one month, provided suf ficient cause is shown by the appellant .\n7. Though the lower appellate  authority  may be right in holding that while it may allow filing of an appeal\nbeyond the limitatio n of three months for a further period of one month, but the delay beyond the extended\nperiod of one month  cannot be condone d, we are of the view that such a stand taken by respondent No.2 may\nadversely affect the petitioner . This is more so because respondent No.1 had suo motu cancelled the GST\nregistration of the petitioner on the ground of non-filing of returns and as GST Tribunal has not been\nconstituted under Section 109 of the CGST Act, petitioner would be left without any remedy .\n8. We further find that the issue pertains to cancellation of GST registration of the petitioner . In the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, it would be just and proper if the entire matter is remanded back to respondent No.1\nto reconsider the case of the petitioner and thereafter to pass appropriate order in accordance with law .\n9. In the light of the above and without expressing any opinion on merit, we remand the matter back to the file\nof respondent No.1 to consider the grievance expressed by the petitioner against cancellation of GST\nregistration and thereafter pass an appropriate order in accordance with law. Needless to say, when the\nrespondent No.1 hears the matter on remand, petitioner would be at liberty to submit the returns as per the\nstatute.\n10. Writ petition is accordingly disposed of.\n11. Miscellaneous applications pending, if any , shall stand closed. However , there shall be no order as to costs.\n*Partly in favour of assessee."}

Asstt. Commissioner  (ST) [2020] 115 taxmann.com 429 (AP)\n(para 4).\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner seeks writ of mandamus  declaring the impugned appeal rejection\norder No. ZH370720 OD36161, dated 28-7-2020, passed by the 1st respondent rejecting the appeal S.18/2019-\n20 filed by the petitioner after nearly one year on the ground that it was filed manually instead of\nelectronically as contrary to rule 108(1) of APGST Rules, 2017 and consequently , direct the 1st respondent to\ndecide the appeal on merits.\n2. The petitioner's case succinctly is thus :\nThe 2nd respondent passed assessment orders dated 6-5-2019 for the tax periods 09/17 to 04/18 under the\nIGST , CGST and APGST Acts by imposing tax on un-fructified sales. Aggrieved, the petitioner preferred\nstatutory appeal before the 1st responden t on 28-8-2019. As the rule 108 of APGST Rules, 2017 permits filing\nof appeal electronically , the petitioner had, first attempted to file the appeal electronically but the same wasnot received by the Department Website due to some glitches and therefore, the petitioner filed the same\nmanually before the 1st respondent and obtained the acknowledgement dated 28-8-2019. However , the 1st\nrespondent passed the impugned appeal rejection order dated 28-7-2020 on the sole ground that the appeal\nwas not filed by the petitioner electronically .\nHence, the instant writ petition.\n3. Heard learned coun sel for petitioner , Sri G.Narendra Chetty and learned Gove rnment Pleader representing\nthe of fice of the Advocate General - II.\n4. Learned counsel for petitioner would strenuously argue that the order of rejection is quiet contrary to rule\n108 of A.P.GST Rules, 2017 inasmuch as the said Rule gives liberty to an appellant  to file an appeal with\nrequired forms and relevant documents 'either electronically or otherwise as may be notified by the Chief\nCommissioner '. Since, as of now, the Chief Commissioner  has not notified any particular form for filing\nappeal, the concerned appellant  is at liberty to file the appeal by choosing either mode. Learned counsel would\nfurther submit that in fact the petitioner tried to upload the appeal electronically  through the website of the 1st\nrespondent but since he was not fructified due to some technical glitches, he had resorted to the manual mode\nand the same was accepted by the office of the 1st respondent  vide acknowledgment dated 28-8-2019. In that\nview of the matter , it is quite unjust and illegal on the part of the 1st respondent to reject the appeal only on\nthe sole ground that appeal was not filed electronically . Learned counsel relied upon the judgment of Division\nBench of this Court in Sri Siddhi  Kalko Bhagavan Stone Crus her v. Asstt. Commissioner  (ST) [2020] 115\ntaxmann.com 429  argue that in similar  circumstances this Court directed the respondent Department therein to\nreceive the appeal and pass appropriate orders.\n5. Per contra, learned  Government Pleader representing learned Additional Advocate General - II would\nvehemently argue that as many as three check memos dated 24-2-2020, 17-3-2020 and 6-6-2020 were issued\nto the petitioner to comply with certain defects in his appeal but without first rectifying the defects and\nelectronically uploading the appeal, the appellant  has resort ed to the writ petition, which is untenable. Learned\nGovernment Pleader  sought to argue that it is only when an appellant  complies with the conditions narrated in\nrule 108(1) of APG ST Rules, 2017 i.e., filing the appeal with required documents and forms, then only the\nquestion of choosing one of the modes of filing does arise (i.e., either electronically or manually). When the\npetitioner/ appellant  has not complied with the check mem os, he has no right to claim that his appeal which\nwas filed manually should be accepted.\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow .\n7. We have given anxious consideration to the facts and above respective arguments. The operative portion of\nthe impugned order reads thus :\n\"As seen from the above provisions the appeal should be filed either electronically or otherwise as may\nbe notified  by the Chief Commissioner  it does not mean manual filing of the appeal, till now the Chief\nCommissioner  has not given any instruction to accept the manual filing of the appeal.\"\n8. The above order would show that the appeal was rejected on the prime observation that though an appellant\ncan file the appeal either electronically or otherwise, it does not mean that manual filing of the appeal can be\ndone since the Chief Commissioner  has not given any instructions to accept the manual filing of the appeal as\nof now . We are afraid, this interpretation of rule 108 of AP GST Rules, 2017, is not correct.\n9. For better appreciation, rule 108(1) of AP GST Rules, 2017 is extracted here.\n\"An appeal to the Appellate  Auth ority under sub-section (1) of section 107 shall be filed in form GST\nAPL-01 along with the relevant documents, either electronically or otherwise as may be notified by the\nChief Commissioner  and a provisional acknowledgment shall be issued to the appellant  immediately .\"\n10. As can be seen from rule 108(1) of AP GST Rules, 2017, the language employed therein is as clear as\ncrystal to the effect that an appeal to the appellate  authority under section 107(1) of the AP GST Act shall be\nfiled along with form GST APL-01 and the relevant documents 'either electronically or otherwise as may be\nnotified by the Chief Commissioner '. So, till the Chief Commissioner  specifies one partic ular mode of filing,\nthe concerned appellant  can choose to file the appeal either electronically or otherwise i.e., manually . In that\nview , the interpretati on of the 1st respondent that since the Chief Commissioner  has not given notification that\nthe manual filing of the appeal can be accepted by the appellate  authority, the appellant  cannot file the appeal\nin manual form is contrary to the purport of rule 108(1) of AP GST Rules, 2017.SB11. In similar circumstances, Division Bench of this Court in Sri Siddhi Kalko (supra ) held thus :\n\"Having regard to the facts and submissions and as the case of the petitioner requires adjudication on\nmerits and when substantial justice is pitted against technical considerations, it is always necessary to\nprefer the ends of justice, we are of the considered view that the request of the petitioner merits\nconsideration. Such course also would help the petitioner in having his cause decided on merits.\"\n12. The other argument  of learned Governm ent Pleader representing learned Additional Advocate General - II\nalso is not formidab le. All the check memos referred to by him were issued only after filing of the appeal\nmanually . Thereafte r, the appellate  authority has rejected the appeal not on the merits but on the sole ground\nas we mentioned  supra . Since the rejection order is contrary to rule 108(1) of AP GST Rules, 2017, the same\nis liable to be set aside.\n13. In the result, this writ petition is allowed setting aside the impugned order passed by the 1st respondent\nwith a direction that the 1st respondent shall receive the appeal, process the same and if there are any defects\nin the appeal, issue suitable check memos for compliance by the petitioner , in which case, the petitioner shall\ncomply the same within the time prescribed and resubmit the appeal either electronically or manually\nwhereupon the 1st respondent shall consider the appeal and after hearing the petitioner , pass appropriate order\non merits in accordance with the governing law and rules.\nAs a sequel, miscellaneous applications pending for consideration, if any , shall stand closed. No costs.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Harinath,\nlearned Deputy Solicitor General of India and Sri Suresh Kumar Routhu, learned Standing Counsel for\nRespondent No.4.\n2. An order of cancellation of registration passed by the Goods and Services Tax Officer, Jagannayakpur -1st\nrespondent herein, dated 01.02.2022 under the provisions of section 29 of the Central Goods and Services Tax\nAct, 2017, is under challenge in the present W rit Petition.\n3. According to the petitioner , he is a diet contractor , carrying on contracts with the Government General\nHospitals for supply of food to the in-patients at the subsidized price fixed by the State Government. Preceded\nby a show-cause notice dated 06.12.2021, the first respondent herein issued the impugned cancellation order\ndated 01.02.2022. It is absolutely not in controversy that in response to the show-cause notice issued by the\nfirst respondent, the petitioner herein did not file any reply/explanation. However , at paragraphs 3 and 4 of the\naffidavit filed in support of the W rit Petition, the following reasons are shown by the petitioner:\n\"3. The Petitioner has entered into contract with the Government General Hospitals for supply of food to\nthe in patients at the subsidized price fixed by the State Government and such supplies are classifiable as\nRestaurant Services taxable @ 5% under the GST Act. Accordingly , the Petition er has been reporting theSHREY Avalue of supplies through the monthly returns and dischar ging the tax liability since December , 2018. The\nPetitioner did not file monthly Returns  in Form GSTR-3B for the months from May-2021 to January-\n2022 since it did not receive bills from the Government in time. The petitioner  was allotted contract by\nthe State Government for supply of diet to the COVID-19 patients who were under quarantine in\nisolation wards in the Government General Hospitals, Kurnool and Kakin ada. The Petitioner has\nexecuted the contracts by borrowing money by way of hand loans and from  financial institutions on\ninterest and raised bills on the Governm ent General Hospital, Kurnool for an amount of Rs.2,80,93,215\nfor the period from October , 2020 to December , 2021. The bills were accepted but not paid by the\nHospital in spite of repeated requests. The petitioner has approached this Hon' ble High Court vide Writ\nPetition No.16887 of 2022 and on the directions of this Hon'ble High Court by the order dated 20.7.2022\n(Ex.P-1), the respondents have disbursed the amount in the month of August, 2022. Similarly for the food\nsupplied to the Covid patients in the Government General Hospital, Kakinada an amount of\nRs.2,79,12,042/- for the period from May, 2021  to March, 2022 is paid to the Petitioner in August, 2022\nas per the Ref. Coordn. 6/100/2922, dated 16.08.2022 of the District Collector , Kakinada (Ex.P-2).\n4. In these circumsta nces, the Petitioner could not file the Returns for the tax periods from May, 2021 to\nJanuary , 2022 within the prescribed time. The GST network is so designed that a taxable person will be\nable to file monthly Returns in Form GSTR-3B only if he is prepared to discha rge the tax liability along\nwith interest, if any generated. The GST network does not allow to file the returns declaring the tax\nliability and dischar ge the liability along with interest at a later date. Further , until the prior months\nreturns are filed, the filing of Returns for the subsequent period does not arise.\"\n4. It is also pertinent to extract paragraph 7 of the Af fidavit:\n\"The Petitioner could borrow money in July, 2022 and could not get the returns filed by his Accountant\nfor the tax periods from May, 2021 to January , 2022 by paying tax, interest and late fee of a sum of\nRs.7,80,902/-Statement of tax paid for these months is filed as Ex.P-5. However , it could not file the\nreturns for the months from February , 2022 onwards as it is informed that its certificate of registration\nwas cancelled and due to such cancellation, the filing of Returns for the period subsequent to the ef fective\ndate of cancellation is not possible though there is liability to pay tax. The Petitioner is ready to comply\nwith the filing of the Returns and payment of taxes along with the interest and fee due under the GST Act\nif it is given another chance. The Petitioner is deprived of its right to carry on the business and the right\nto life guaranteed under Articles 14 read with 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India.\"\n5. During the course  of the arguments,  learned Government Pleader and the learned Standing Counsel,\nstrongly opposing the Writ Petition contended that having failed to respond to the show-cause notice and\nhaving failed to avail alternative remedy as prescribed under the provisions of section 107 of the CGST Act,\n2017, it is not open for the writ petitioner to maintain the present Writ Petition under Article 226 of the\nConstitution of India.\n6. Acco rding to the learned counsel for the petitioner , the petitioner herein is ready to furnish all the necessary\ninformation, but, in view of cancellation  order , the petitioner is not in a position to furnish the same to the 1st\nrespondent.\n7. The reality remains  that according to section 107 of the CGST , 2017, any perso n aggrieved by any decision\nor order passed under this Act or the State Goods and Services Tax Act or the Union Territory Goods and\nServices Tax Act by an adjudicating authority may appeal to such appellate authroity as may be prescribed\nwithin three months from the date on which the said decision or order is communicated to such person.\n8. For the reasons mentioned in the supporting affidavit and taking into consideration the submissions made\nby the learned counsel for the petition er, this Court deems it appropriate to dispose of the Writ Petition,\nleaving it open to the petitioner to approach the appellant authority as per section 107 of CGST Act, 2017,\nwithin a period of one week from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and if such an appeal is filed, the\nsame be considered and appropriate orders be passed by the appellate authori ty strictly in accordance with\nrules, within a period of four (04) weeks thereafter .\n9.

Durga  Prasad Rao, J. - In this Writ Petiti on filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the\npetitioner seeks the following relief:\n\"to issue Wirt of Mandamus or any other appropriate Writ or Order or Direction declaring the action of\nthe 2nd Respondent in passing Order dated 10-7-2023 having reference No. DIN3716052325788/2017-\n18, DIN3 716052314875/2018- 19, DIN3716052378825/ 2019-20, DIN 3716052376971/2020-21\ndirecting payment of tax Rs. 1,05,1 1,640/- penalty and Interest of Rs. 65,56,64 9/as arbitrary , contrary to\nlaw and in violation  of principles of natural justice and/or pass such other order  or orders as the Hon'ble\nCourt may deem fit and proper in the circumstance of the case.\"\n2. The petitioner's grievance is that he is the owner of the Godown Nos.03, 07, 08 & 09 having total capacity\nof 35000 Mts situated at M/s Jagadish & Others Warehouses, Bhanuprakash Nagar , Sitarampet Village,\nYerpedu Mandal, Chittoor District. The said godown were used to provide services of storage and\nwarehousing to clients such as Andhr a Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corpo ration Ltd (APSCSCL). The\npetitioner received monitory consideration as per the agreement for the period between 2017 and 2021 a sum\nof Rs. 5.83,98,000/-  . Later the Regional Vigilance and Enforcement Officer inspected his warehouse and\nthereafter a show cause notice was issued to the petitioner on 4-2-2022 stating that the services provided by\nthe petitioner amounts to renting of immovable property and therefore the same is not exempted from tax. The\npetitioner filed objections contending that the services of storage and warehousing of food grains  is exempted\nfrom levy of tax as per Notification No. 12/2017 - Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017. The activity\nundertaken by the petitioner is that it had entered into an agreement with APSCSCL for providing storage,\nwarehousing services involving loading, unloading, stacking, packing, care, custody and security etc., of food\ngrains  and the activity of storage or warehousing of rice is specifically covered under entries prescribed in\nSl.No.24 and also under Sl.No.3 or Sl.No.54 of Notification No. 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-\n2017 and it is exempted from payment of tax. However , without considering  the reply of the petitioner in\nproper manner , the 2nd respondent held that the petitioner has let out 35000 Mts of space on monthly rental\nbasis and delivered possession and therefore the said activity attracts tax @ 9% under SGST & CGST as\nprescribed in Entry No. 997212 and disagreed with the contention of the petitioner that the services rendered\nby the petitioner are exempted under Notification No12/2017 - Central T ax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017:\n(a) It is the case of the petitioner that under Notification No. 12/2017, all the services related to\nsupplies like loading, unloading, storag e or warehousing including those of renting and leasing is\nexempted from tax if such supplies are made to the Government or Government Authority . The\nAPSCSCL is apparently a Government Authority as the Government holds more than 90% on\nequity shares and therefore, the transaction exempted from tax.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. The 2nd respondent filed counter and opposed the writ petition:\n(a) It is firstly  contende d that the writ petition is not maintainable under law since the petitioner has an\nefficacious and alternative remedy of appeal. On merits of the petitioner's case it is contended that\nas per agreement dated 30-1-2021 entered into by the petitioner with APSCSCL, the service\nrendered by the petitioner to APSCSCL is merely supply of rental space of non-residential property .\nFurther , any further services rendered by the petitioner are also on the basis of working of such\nservice charges into the rental component. Such renting of space cannot be said to be service related\nto storage or warehousing of the goods. Rental income received by the applicant from renting\nwarehouse to storage of food grains  is a consideration for supply and the activity is covered under\nsection - 7 (Schedule II) of the CGST Act, 2017. The Notification No. 12/2017 the entries of which\nthe petitioner places reliance, pertains to tabulated classifications of only such services as against\nthe Gover nment prescribes \"NIL\" rate. The income derived from rental agreement squarely falls\nunder GST Taxation purposes i.e., Sl.No.16(Heading 9972) - \"Real Estate Services\" under\nNotification No. 1 1/2017. The respondent challenged the writ petition also on dif ferent grounds.\n4. Heard Sri Shaik Jeelani Basha, learned counsel for the petitioner and learn ed Government Pleader for\nCommercial T axes-II representing respondents.\n5. While learned counsel for the petitioner Sri Shaik Jeelani Basha reiterated his pleadings in his argument,\nlearned Government Pleader took a fundamental objection regarding the entertainability of the writ petition onRITESHthe ground that the petitioner has an efficacious and alternative remedy of appeal and therefore the writ\npetition is not maintainable. He placed reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in Assistant\nCommissioner (CT) LTU, Kakinada  v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. 2020 SCC OnLine SC\n440 = (2020) 19 SCC 681/[2020] 1 16 taxmann.com 417/2020 (36) G.S.T .L. 305 (SC) .\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow?\n7. POINT :- We gave our anxious consideration to the above respective submissions, particularly the\npreliminary objection of learned Government Pleader regarding the entertainability of the writ petition.\nAdmittedly , the petitioner has an efficacious and alternative remedy to file appeal. The said fact is also\nmentioned in the impugned order to the effect that an appeal lies against the impugned order before the\nAppellate Joint Commissioner (ST), T irupathi.\n8. In that view of the matter and also in view of the decision in Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care\nLtd's  case (Supra 1) wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the High Court ought not to have entertained\nthe writ petition when an efficacious and alternative remedy of appeal is available to the petitioner , without\nexpressing our opinion on the merits of the petitioner's case, we deem it apposite to give liberty to the\npetitioner to file an appeal against the impugned order .\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is disposed of giving liberty to the petitioner to file an appeal against the\nimpugned order dated 10-7-2023 passe d by the 2nd respondent before the concerned Appellate Authority\nwithin four (4) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order , in which case, the Appellate Authority\nshall admi t the appeal and after affordin g an opportunity of hearing to both parties, pass an appropriate order\non merits in accordance with governing law and rules expeditiously . Till the time granted for filing of appeal\nis over, the respondent authorities shall not take any coercive action against the petitioner for recovery of\ndemanded tax under the impugned order . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending if any shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Praveen Kumar , J. - The present W rit Petition came to be filed seeking issuance of a writ of Mandamus to\ndeclare the inaction of the Respondents to reopen the portal immediately enabling the Writ Petitioner to\nsubmit its GST TRA N-1 Form in the GSTN Portal in terms of section 140 of the CGST and APSGST Act,\n2017; or in the altern ative, permit the Writ Petitioner to submit GST TRAN-1 manually with a direction to the\nRespondents to consider the same in accordance with law. It is further pleaded that, a direction may be given\nto Respondent no. 1 and 4 to grant refund of VAT credit of Rs. 1,92,095/-, to which the Writ Petitioner is\nentitled for .\n2. The facts, in issue, are that:\n(i) The Writ Petitioner is a partnership concern doing business in pulses and turme ric registered under\nthe APSGST Act 2017 and CGST Act, 2017 bearing GSTI No. 37ACSFS7596P1ZL. In short, the\nrequest of the Writ Petitioner is, to direct the Respondents to accept his Form GST TRAN-1\nenabling him to claim transitional credit  of the eligible taxes in respect of the excess input tax credit\nof Rs. 1,92,095/- on the appointed day i.e., 01st July, 2017 in terms of section 140(1) and (3) of the\nAPSGST/CGST Act, 2017 read with Rule 1 17 of the Central Goods and Services T ax Rules, 2017.\n(ii) It is pleaded that, the Writ Petitioner could not upload the Form GST TRAN-1 due to technical\nglitches in terms of poor internet conne ctivity and other technical difficulties on the GST common\nportal. It is further pleaded that, the Writ Petitioner also met the 1st Respondent being the Nodal\nOfficer from time-to-time and also addre ssed letters to the concerned for allowing him to file online\nForm GST TRAN-1 in terms of the decision of the GST Tax Council and Circular , dated 3-4-2018.\nThe Writ Petitioner  claims to have addressed letters to the 1st Respondent on 27-12-2019, but,\nnothing turned out from the same. The Writ Petitioner placed on record numb er of judgments to\nshow that, when the petitioner was not able to gain access to the portal due to technical difficulties\nor due to ignorance of the usage of technology , the courts permitted the petitioners therein to apply\nmanually . In other words, his plea is that, technology has been added to the system for the benefit\nand convenience of the tax payers, but it should not be subservient to the purpose and hence the\nimpediments, if any, should not make the Writ Petitioner servants of the technology . He further\npleads that, the authorities have time and again extended the last date for claiming input credit, but,\nhis efforts to upload  the Form proved futile for many a reasons. Hence, the present Writ Petition is\nfiled seeking manual submission of Form GST TRAN-1.\n3. The same is serious ly opposed by the learned Counsel for the Respondents by placing the Judgment of the\nDivision Bench of the Madras High Court in P.R. Electr onics  v. Union of India [2020] 117 taxmann .com 868.\nInsofar as the judgment delivered by this court is concerned, the Counsel for the Respondents would contend\nthat, since  the Petitioner therein was illiterate, this Court permitted him to submit GST TRAN-1 manually ,\nbut, the instant case stands on an altogether dif ferent footing.\n4. In reply , the Counsel for the Writ Petitioner placed on record phtostat copie s of screen shots of GSTN\ncommon portal indicating the ef forts made by the W rit Petitioner trying to submit TRAN-1 Form.\n5. In order to deal with the issue raised, it is to be noted that, Section 40 of SGST  Act provides for transfer of\nthe amoun t of Value Added Tax Credit carried forward under the APVAT Act, 2005 to the GST regime, which\nreads as under:\u2014\n\"140. T ransitional Arrangements for Input T ax Credit:\u2014\n(1) A registered person, other than a person opting to pay tax under section 10, shall be entitled to take, in\nhis electronic credit ledger , credit of the amount of V alue Added T ax carried forward in the return relating\nto the period ending with the day immediately preceding the appointed day, furnished by him under the\nexisting law , in such manner as may be prescribed:\nProvided  that the registered person shall not be allowed to take credit in the following  circumstances,\nnamely:\u2014\n(i) where the said amount of credit is not admissible as input tax credit under this Act; or\n(ii) where he has not furnished all the returns required under the existing law for the period of\nsix months immediately preceding the appointed date; or\n(iii) where the said amount of credit relate s to goods manufactured and cleared under suchS.K. JAINexemption notifications as are notified by the Government. . . . . .\".\n6. Rule 117 of the SGST Rules, 2017 was introduced to provide for the mode and manner in which such credit\nis to be carried forward. The relevant portion of the Rule reads as under:\n\"117. Tax or duty credit carried forward under any existing law or on goods held in stock on the\nappointed day:\n(1) Every registered person entitled to take credit of input tax under section 140 shall, within ninety days\nof the appointed day, submit a declara tion electronically in Form GST TRAN-1, duly signed, on the\ncommon portal specifying therein, separately , the amount of input tax credit to which he is entitled under\nthe provisions of the said section:\nProvided  that the Commissi oner may, on the recommendations of the Council, exten d the period of\nninety days by a further period not exceeding ninety days . . . . .\"\n7. Rule 117 of the SGST Rules prescribed a period of 90 days from the appointed day to file Form GST\nTRAN-1 mentioning  the amount of transitional input tax credit claimed by the registered person. The Form\nGST TRA N-1 is to be filed electronical ly on the common portal within the time fixed in the Rule initially or\nextended by notifications.\n8. Though the prescrib ed time of 90 days from the appointed date expired on 29-9-2017, but the Respondent\nauthorities have been extending time for uploading V AT Credit in Form TRAN-1 from time-to-time.\n9. The averm ents in the affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition shows that, the Writ Petitioner has been\ntrying to upload the said form, but was unsuccessful in doing so for various reasons, like poor internet\nconnection and the technical difficulties of GSTN common portal. The contents of the affidavit also makes it\nclear that the Writ Petitioner met the Nodal Officer from time-to-time explaining his grievances in uploading\nthe Form TRAN-1 apart from addressing letters to the concerned. Therefore, the argument of the Standing\nCounsel that the Writ Petitioner has not come forward with a genuine reason seeking submission of\napplication manually may not be correct.\n10. In Lantech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Pr. CIT [2019] 111 taxmann.com 144, a similar issue came up before\nthe Divisi on Bench of this Court for consideration. Relying upon the judgments in Uninav Developers (P.)\nLtd. v. Union of India  [W.P. (C) No. 1377 of 2018, dated 29-7-2019], Bhar gava Motors  v. Union of India\n[2019] 106 taxmann .com 200/74 GST 340 (Delhi) , Kusum Enterprises (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India [2020] 114\ntaxmann.com 501 (Delhi)  and Sanko Gosei Technology India (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  [W.P. (C) No. 7335 of\n2019, dated 12-7-20 19], the Court disposed of the writ petition, on 13-8-2019, directing the respondents to\neither open the portal so as to enable the petitioner to again file the Form GST TRAN-1 electronically or in\nthe alternative, accept the Form GST TRAN-1 presented manually by fixing a cut of date and process the\nclaim in accordance with law .\n11. The Judg ment deliv ered in W.P. No. 3298 of 2019 was followed by another Division Bench in W.P. No.\n15769 of 2019, to which one of us was a party .\n12. Having regard to the judgments referred to above, this Writ Petition is disposed of in terms thereof\ndirecting the respondents concerned to permit the Writ Petitioner to submit GST TRAN-1 Form electronically\nor, in the alternative, manually , by fixing a cut off date, within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of\njudgment, in which event, the same may be dealt with, in accordance with law . No order as to costs.\n13. Consequently , miscellaneous petitions pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee.\nPartly in favour of assessee"}

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that respondent No. 4 has cancelled the GST registration and\nfurther respondent No. 5 has also rejected the petitioner's application for revoca tion of cancellation  vide  order\nRef.No.ZA371023004149Z, dated 4-10-2023.\n4. The petitioner was issued a show-cause  notice dated 26-6-2023. The order of cancellation was passed on 7-\n7-2023, mentioning that the petitioner did not submit a reply to the show-cause notice.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner submitted a reply on 7-7-2023 itself, i.e., date\nof the order of cancellation. He however submits that the reply was not filed within the time granted in the\nshow cause notice.\n6. For revoc ation of order dated 7-7-2023, the petitioner filed an application, upon which the notice dated 4-8-\n2023 was issued, mentioning that the application for revocation was liable to be rejected for the reasons\ndisclosed that \"according to the field visit report it is a residential house and there is no business running\".\n7. The petiti oner subm itted a reply dated 4-9-2023, interalia submitting that the petitioner took registration on\nhis residential address and he is doing business at the registered address and due to change of mobile number\ngiven at the time of registration which was not working, the communication could not be made. It is further\nsubmitted that there are photographs to show that the business is being run at the registered address.\n8. The application for revocation has been rejected by an order dated 4-10-2023, after examining the\npetitioner's reply on the ground that according to the field visit report it is a residential house and there is no\nbusiness running.\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is running business at the registered address\nbut the petitioner's reply was not considered in proper perspective.\n10. Objection is raised by learned Government Pleader for the respondents that the petitioner has got the\nstatutory remedy to file appeal under the Goods and Services T ax Acts (for short 'GST Act').\n11. He subm its that the physical verification/field visit was made on 26-6-2023 and as per the field visit\nreport, there was no business running in the mentioned address. Subsequently , based on the said report, after\naffording opportuni ty of hearing to the petitioner , the order of cancellation of the GST registration and\nthereafter the order rejecting the application for revocation was passed by Deputy Assistant Commissioner .\n12. From the aforesaid,  it is admitted by the petitioner that he got the registration on his residential address for\nthe business.\n13. The fact of physica l verification finds mention in para-3 of the petitioner's affidavit in support of the writ\npetition in which it is interalia submitted that \"the petitioner sent an explanation in writing on 6-7-2023,\nexplaining that on 26-6-2023, he received a call from a person introducing himself as officer authorized for\nphysical verification of business and existence of the taxpayer , but the petitioner was out of station at that time\nand no one was there at the place of business and consequently no one can be present at the time of\ninspection\".\n14. Further , the petitioner in his application for revocation interalia mentioned as follows:-\n\"I accept that I took registration is taken on my residence address and Business is running as Bill to Ship\nto Model. Sometime the entire consignment is transferred to customer resultantly no will remains at\nbusiness place\".\nIn the said application, the petitioner further submitted as follows:\n\"I hereby promise you that I was not involved in any GST evasion transactions intentionally and\nknowingly . I accept that there was a procedural mistake on part of me for not updating changing of my\nbusiness structure. If I found so I will take the responsibility of reversal/paying all the GST Dues without\nfail.\"\n15. The question if the petitioner was carry ing on his business at the registered address or not at the relevant\npoint of time, is a question of fact. The finding recorded in the order of cancellation of GST registration and inKEV ALthe order rejecting the application for revocation, that the petitioner was not running business at the registered\naddress is a finding of fact, which prima facie  is based on some material in the form of the field inspection\nreport.\n16. If the petitioner's case is contrary , that the business was being run at the registered address and if the\npetitioner has evidence to prove that, as submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner , the appropriate\nforum to reappraise the evidence to determine finding of fact, is not in the writ petition under Article 226 of\nthe Constitution of India.\n17. Undisputedly , the petitioner has got the statutory alternative remedy of appeal. If the petitioner so chooses\nor advised, the remedy of appeal may be availed as per the law .\n18.

Dwarakanath , Adv . for the Petitioner . B. Krishna Mohan , Adv . for the Respondent.\nORDER\n \nC. Praveen Kumar , J. - The present Writ Petition came to be filed under article 226 of the Constitution of\nIndia seeking issuance of writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to allow the petitioner to submit its\nTRAN-1 Form on the GSTN Portal in terms of section 140 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017(for short, \"the CGST Act, 2017) and the Andhra Pradesh State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short,\n\"the APSG ST Act\")  (or) in the alternative, to permit the petitioner to submit TRAN-1 manually and to direct\nthe respondents to consider TRAN-1 so filed and grant the credit in accordance with law .\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner , learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes appearing\nfor respondent Nos.1 and 2, Sri M.V.J.K.Kumar , learned Standing Counsel for respondent Nos.3 and 4, and\nthe learned Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing for respondent No. 5. Perused the record.\n3. The averments in the affidavit filed in support of the petition show that the petitioner is a dealer in\nautomobiles in Kakinada. The petitioner was registered as a Service Provider under the erstwhile Finance Act,\n1994 and also under the Andhra Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2005 (for short , \"the APVAT Act\"). After the\nGoods and Services Tax Act came into force with effect from 01.07.20 17, the petitioner has taken\nindependent registration under the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, \"APGST\nAct, 2017\"). The GST regime which came into effect from 01.07.2017 repealed a host of indirect taxes which\nwere previously in force. Section 140 of APGST Act provides for transfer of input tax credit under the VAT\nAct and CENV AT credit to the GST regime, which reads as under:\u2014\n\"140. T ransitional arrangements for input tax credit:\u2014\n(1) A registered person, other than a person opting to pay tax under section 10, shall be\nentitled to take, in his electronic credit ledger , credit of the amount of Value Added Tax\ncarried forward in the return relating to the period ending with the day immediately\npreceding the appointed day, furnished by him under the existing law, in such manner as\nmay be prescribed:\n Provided that the registered person shall not be allowed to take credit in the following\ncircumstances, namely:\u2014\n(i) where the said amount of credit is not admissible as input tax credit under this\nAct; or\n(ii) where he has not furnished all the retur ns required under the existing law for the\nperiod of six months immediately preceding the appointed date; or\n(iii) where the said amount of credit relates to goods manufactured and cleared under\nsuch exemption notifications as are notified by the Government.\n(2) A registered person, other than a person opting to pay tax under section 10, shall be\nentitled to take, in his electronic credit ledger , credit of the unavailed CENV AT credit in\nrespect of capital goods, not carried forward in a return, furnished under the existing law\nby him, for the period ending with the day immediately preceding the appoin ted day in\nsuch manner as may be prescribed:\nProvided that the registered person shall not be allowed to take credit unless the said credit was\nadmissible as CENV AT credit under the existing law and is also admissible as input tax credit under this\nAct.\"\nRule 1 17 of the CGST Rules, 2017 was introduced to provide for the mode and manner in which such credit is\nto be carried forward. The relevant portion of the Rule reads as under:\n\"117. Tax or duty credit carried forwar d under any existing law or on goods held in stock on the\nappointed day: (1) Every  registered person entitled to take credit of input tax under section 140 shall,\nwithin ninety days of the appointed day, submit a declaration electronically in Form GST TRAN-1, duly\nsigned, on the common portal specifyin g therein, separately , the amount of input tax credit of eligible\nduties and taxes, as defined in Explanation  2 to section 140, to which he is entitled under the provisions\nof the said section: Provided that the Commissioner may, on the recommendatio ns of the Council, extend\nthe period of ninety days by a further period not exceeding ninety days.\"\nTherefore, Rule 117 of the CGST Rules, 2017 prescribed a period of 90 days from the appointed day to\nfile Form GST TRA N-1 mentioning the amount of transitional input tax credit claimed by the registered\nperson. The Form GST TRAN-1 is to be filed electronically on the common portal within the time fixed\nin the Rule initially or extended by notifications.\u00a6\u00a6The prescribed period of 90 days from the appointed day expired on 29.9.2017 and thereafter , it was\nbeing extended from time to time. The claim of the petitioner is that initially , it tried to upload the details\nof the input tax credit in Form TRAN-1 on 27.12.2017 but the same could not be uploaded due to some\ntechnical errors. Subsequently , the petitioner approached the GST help desk for support. The petitioner\nmade its grievance vide Grievance No. GA370418000092H on 04.04.2018 on the GSTN Network with\nthe following grievance:\n\"TRAN-1 not opened even after two weeks' time\".\nIn response to the same, the petitioner received e-mail from the common portal on 04.04.2018 (Ex.P-2) at\n12:50 P.M. that the grievance of the petitioner has been successfully submitted and the Grievance Tracking\nNumber is GA3704 18000092H. Thereafter , the petitioner has not heard anything from the respondents and\nthere is no improvement in the Grievance Redressal.\nThe petitioner wrote to respondent No. 1 on 19.07.2018 (Ex.P-3) that it could not file TRAN-1 even after\nmaking several efforts to file application in time due to failure of the electronic system. The petitioner\nsubmitted that it will be put to severe loss of the credit if the credit of Rs. 10,01,963/-, which it is otherwise\nentitled, is not available. The petitioner submitted the details of the inputs held in stock in pre-GST period and\nrequested respondent No. 1 to do the needful.\nAs the time fixed for filing the GST TRAN-1 electronically expired, the petitio ner approached the authorities\nto submit the application manually but the authorities have not taken any action on the same.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has made an attempt to get its application\nprocessed but the learned Government Pleader opposed the same.\n5. No mater ial is placed before this Court to show that the petitioner has made an attempt to get its application\nprocessed. However , Sri S. Dwarakanath, learned counsel for the petitioner , submits that the petitioner has\nmade an attempt but it could not succeed as it did not reach the portal. He further submits that now, the\nauthorities are allowing them to make an application provided they show some proof, which according to\nthem, cannot be produced after length of time more particularly , the screened shots.\n6. At this stage, learne d Standing Counsel would submit that the time fixed for submitting Form GST TRAN-\n1 is extended up to 31.12.2019.\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner subm its that the petitioner is not technically well versed in these aspects\nand unable to upload the forms. In support of his plea, learned counsel relied upon a judgment, dated\n13.08.2019, of the Division Bench passed by this Court in Lantech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Pr. CIT [2019]\n111 taxmann.com 144/31 GSTL 392 in which a similar issue came up for consideration. Relying upon the\njudgments in Uninav Developers (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  [W.P. (C) No. 13772 of 2018, dated 29-7-2019],\nBhar gava Motors  v. Union of India [2019] 106 taxmann.com 200/74 GST 340, Kusum Enterprises (P.) Ltd. v.\nUnion of India  [WP (C) 7423 of 2019, dated 12-7-2019 ] and Sanko Gosei Technology India (P.) Ltd. v. Union\nof India  [WP(C)7335 of 2019, dated 12-7-2019], this Court disposed of the writ petition directing the\nrespondents to either open the portal to enable the petitioner to again file the Form GST TRAN-1\nelectronically or in the alternative, accept the Form GST TRAN-1 presen ted manually , on or before\n31.08.2019 and process the claim in accordance with law .\n8. It is to be noted that the aforesaid judgment of this Court delivered on 13.08.2019 was not challenged\nbefore the higher Court and the same has become final.\n9. The arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be brushed aside. Having regard to the\njudgment referred above in Lantech Pharmaceuticals  (supra ), this W rit Petition is disposed of in terms thereof\ndirecting the respondents to either open the portal to enable the petitioner to again file the Form GST TRAN-1\nelectronically or in the alternative, accept the Form GST TRAN-1 presen ted manually , on or before\n31.12.2019. It is needless to say that the petitioner's claim shall be processed in accordance with law. There\nshall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J.  - The petitioner prays for writ of mandamus declaring:\n(a) Section 16(4) of APGST Act, 2017 and section 16(4) of CGST Act, is violative  of article 14, 19(1)\n(g) and section 300-A of Constitution of India.\n(b) That the non-obstante  clause in section16(2) of APGST/CGST Act, 2017 would prevail over\nsection 16(4) of APGST/CGST Act, 2017.\n(c) That notification issued by Government of Andhra Pradesh  vide G.O.Ms.No.264, dated 11-9-2020\nand providing extension of time for filing returns only to the non-resid ent and not allowing such\nextension to the others and thereby distinguishing other tax payers on account of COVID-19\npandemic is arbitrary , illegal and violative of article 14 of Constitution of India.\n(d) That the action of Respondent No. 1 in passing summary order  vide ref No. ZD370322002865K,\ndated 15-3-2022 in Form GST DRC-07 under the GST Acts, without serving proper show cause\nnotice in Form GST DRC-01 and grant ing sufficient opportunity to the petitioner u/s 74(5) of the\nAct and not considering petitioner's submissions and COVID-19 limitations r/w Amnesty\nNotifications but confirming the demand of tax, interest and penalty by restric ting the credit with\nerroneous facts in spite of collection of late fee of Rs. 10,000/- for the delay for filing the returns isnot only violative of principles of natural justice but also arbitrary , improper , illegal and violative of\narticle 14, 19(1)( g), 20, 21 and 300-A of Constitution of India and consequently  set aside the\nsummary order/proc eedings of the 1st respondent as null and void and pass such other order\ndeemed fit in the circumstances of the case.\n2. Petitioner's case briefly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a sole proprietorship doing business in hardware and plywood with the trade name\n\"Tirumalakonda Plywoods\" commenced during Covid-19 pandemic and registered under APGST\nAct and CGST Act during March, 2020.\n(b) While so, petitioner received email dated 16-12-2021 u/s 74(1) of SGST/CGST Act r/w section 20\nof IGST Act, 2017 by the 1st respondent stating that the petitioner availed input for March, 2020\nand sought reply in the light of Gazette notification of CCT's Ref. No. CCW/GST20015-A, dt;\n30.0-6-2017.\n(c) Though the above notice was sent through a private gmail ID and not following the procedure\nunder rule 142 (1) of APGST Rules, 2017 and not served through its GST common portal or\nspecified any time for reply as per Form GST DRC-01, still the petitioner submitted reply through\ne-mail dated 17-1-2022 with its Form GST DRC-06 and enclosed Annexure-I wherein the\npetitioner sought an opportunity u/s 74(5) of APGST Act, 2017, since the petitioner not only\ndischar ged late fee for delay in filing the return but also challenged notice with his detailed\nsubmissions.\n(d) Instead of considerin g petitioner's reply in Form GST DRC 06, the 1st respondent surprisingly sent\na personal hearing notice dated 22-2-20 22 through private e-mail ID stating that the petitioner did\nnot file reply agains t their notice nor opted for personal hearing and hence he has to file reply on or\nbefore 22-2-2022 and attend personal hearing on 2-3-2022.\n(e) Against the above notice, the petitioner through his advocate confirmed that he already filed his\nreply dated 17-1-2022.\n(f) Subsequently the petitioner received e-mail dated 14-3-2022 sent by the 1st respondent along with\nan attachment containing order  vide AOO No. ZH370322OD48625, dated 14-3-2022 whereunder ,\nwithout considering the objections raised by the petitioner in his reply , the 1st respondent wrongly\nheld as if the petitioner made an irregular claim of ITC of an amount of Rs. 4,78,626/- and fixed Rs.\n11,24,994/- towards tax, penalty and interest.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. 1st respondent filed counter contending thus:\n(a) The writ petition is perverse and liable to be dismissed in limini as the writ petition cannot be filed\ncontrary to the legislative intent. Further , the petitioner has an efficacious alternative remedy of\nappeal.\n(b) It is false to allege that notice dt: 16-12-2021 was sent by department through private e-mail ID.\nThe said e-mail ID is the official e-mail ID allotted to the 1st respondent. Further, the notice was\nsent in Form GST DRC-01 as per Rule 142 of GST Rules, 2017 and various contentions raised by\nthe petitio ner in his reply have been considered in a just and proper manner and without any bias\nand they were rejec ted on cogent reaso ns. Further , before passing order , in terms of section 75(4)\nand (5) of GST Act, 2017 a brief show cause notice was issued and an oppo rtunity of personal\nhearing was given to the petitioner . Thereby principles of natural justice were followed. As the\nreply filed by the petitioner was not in accordance with the provisions of GST Act and Rules, 2017\nthe same was rightl y rejected. Therefore, it is false to core to contend that the reply filed by the\npetitioner was not considered before passing the impugned order . No provision s of Articles 14, 16\nand 19(1)( g) of the Constitution of India have been infringed in the instant case. In fact those\nArticles have no relevancy to the case on hand.\n(c) It is further contended that in view of plethora of decisions of Apex Court reiterating that short\ncircuiting of the statutory remedies is not permissible when statutory alternative remedy is\navailable, the writ petition is not maintainable. It is also contended that collection of late fee neverbe immun e for other aspects such as output tax payment and demand for interest on belated\npayment as well as claiming of input tax with the prescribed conditions within the stipulated time\nperiod. The collection of late fee is exclusively relating to only for the issue of belated filing of\nreturn but not else. It never precludes the actions prescribed under the provisions in section 61 to 74\nof SGST/CGST Acts r/w section 20 of IGST Act. The Government had given time upto 30-6-2020\nfor filing return relating to the month of March, 2020 but even then the petitioner not filed the\nreturn even after the date prescribed for filing the return relating to the month of September of\nsucceeding year i.e., on or before 20-10-2020. The burden of filing monthly returns and other\nmonthly statements lies with the petitio ner. The petitioner can claim ITC subject to fulfillment of\nconditions laid in section 16 of SGST/CGST Act r/w section 20 of IGST Act. section 16(4) of\nSGST/CGST Act is clear to the effect that any claim made through GSTR-III B return filed after\nprescribed date shall not be valid. Any time extended for filing  returns either as a part of new\nenactment or as a part of COVID-19 has to be obliged and returns to be filed within such time only .\nIf there is no time limitation, one would go on claiming ITC after indefinite period, which woul d\ndefeat the very purpose of the limitatio n prescribed in the enactment. Therefore, it is the primary\nobligation of the taxable person to scrupulously abide the statutory obligations.\n(d) It is not obligatory on the part of Assessing Authority to issue opportunity under section 74(5) of\nthe APGST/CGST Acts, 2017 as it is only optional. The petitioner obtained registration voluntarily\nand therefore, there is no separate provision or special exemption for the taxable person.\n(e) It was only a proposal made to levy penalty at the rate equivalent to the amount of Input Tax\nirregularly claimed as the petitioner was reminded with an option for reduced penalty @ 25% of tax\ndemanded if the petitioner pays tax and applicable interest within 30 days from the date of issuance\nof show cause notic e. But the petitioner  did not exercise this option also. Hence  the writ petition is\nliable to be dismissed.\n4. The petitioner filed a lengthy reply denying the counter averments.\n5.

The following points emer ge for consideration :\n(1) Whether by virtue of imposition of time limit for claiming Input Tax Credit (ITC), section 16(4) of\nthe APGS T Act and CGST Act, 2017 violated article 14, 19(1)( g) and 300A  of the Constitution of\nIndia and thereby , liable to be struck down?\n(2) Whether section 16(2) of the APGST/C GST Act, 2017 would prevail over 16(4) of APGST/CGST\nAct, 2017 and thereby if the conditions laid down in section 16(2) of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017\nare fulfilled, the time limit prescribed under section 16(4) of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017 for\nclaiming ITC will pale into insignificance?\n(3) Whether the accept ance of Form GSTR-3B returns of March 2020 filed on 27-11-2020 by the\npetitioner with a late fee of Rs. 10,000/- will exonerate the delay in claiming the ITC beyond the\nperiod specified under section 16(4) of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017?\n(4) Whether summary of the order dated 15-3-2022 under Form GST DRC-07 issued by the 1st\nrespondent is vitiated by the non-serving of show cause notice under Form GST DRC-01 as per the\nprocedure?\n7. Points 1 to 3: - These points are inextricably intertwined and hence, are taken up together .\n8. Contention of petitioner :- The primo genitur e of poignant arguments of learned counsel for petitioner is that\nin view of the petiti oner being new to business and started the same in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, he\ncould not file returns of March 2020 in time and with much difficulty he filed optional form of GSTR3B of\nMarch 2020 by 27-11-2020 and paid late fee of Rs. 10,000/-which was accepted  by the 1st respondent. As the\nreturn was accepted with late fee, learned counsel would argue, it shall be deemed, the 1st respondent\nexonerated the delay if any, for claiming ITC beyond the period prescribed under section 16(4) of the\nAPGST/CGST Act, 2017. As such after scrutiny , the 1st respondent ought to have allowed the ITC claimed\nby the petitioner . However , surprisingly the 1st respondent without issuing any show cause notice in properform and without considering the reply dated 17-1-2022, sent the summary of the order dated 15-3-2022,\nwhereunder , while unjustly disallowin g the ITC of Rs. 4,78,626/- made a demand for payment of Rs.\n11,24,994/- towards  tax, interest and penalty under section 74 of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017. Learned\ncounsel strenuously argued that Input Tax Credit is a statutory right which an assessee is entitled to claim and\nplacing stumbling blocks by way of imposing time limit under section 16(4) of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017\nfrom claim ing such right tantamount to violation of article 14, 19(1)( g) and 300A of the Constitution of India.\nHe would  further argue, section 16(2) of APGST Act/CGST Act, 2017 which commences with a \"non-\nobstantee\" clause will override section 16(4) of the said Act, meaning thereby , if the conditions mentioned in\nsection 16(2) are complied with by an assessee, he will be entitled to claim ITC without reference to the time\nlimit prescribed under section 16(4) and in the instant case, since the 1st respondent permitted the petitioner to\nfile return with late fee of Rs. 10,000/-, the petitioner cannot be deprived of the right of ITC on the sole\nground that claim was made beyond the period prescribed under section 16(4).\n(a) Learned counsel would argue that in the backdrop of facts, the imposition of interest and 100% of\npenalty that too without giving an oppo rtunity of hearing the petitioner is atrocious and liable to be set\naside. He placed reliance on (i) Graintoch Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of C. EX, Aurangabad  2014\n(310) EL T 812 (T ri. - Mum.) ( ii) Sr. Post Master  v. Commissioner of C. EX. & S.T . Bolpur  2016  (42) STR\n542 (T ri. - Kol.) ( iii) Candid Security Services  v. Commissioner of C. EX. & S.T ., Raipur  2019 (28) GSTL\n281 (Tri. - Delhi) (iv) Electic Developers Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Goa 2019 (24) GSTL\n459 (T ri. - Mum.).\n9. Arguments of Advocate General .\u2014In oppugnation, the perspicuous argument of learned Advocate General\nis in the lines that it is misnomer to elevate the refund claim of ITC to the level of an unbridled legal right\nwhere in reality , it is no more than a statutory rebate or a mere concession given to a GST taxpayer as has\nbeen reverberated in a slew of judgmen ts. He placed reliance on Jayam and co. v. Assistant Commissioner\n2016 (15) SCC 125 = [MANU/SC/0956/2016], USA Agencies  v. Commer cial Tax Officer  2013(5) CTC 63,\nALD Auto motive (P.) Ltd. v. Commer cial Tax Officer  (2019) 13 SCC 225/2018 (364) ELT 3. He would\nemphasize, since the ITC is only a concession or rebate, the legislature in its wisdom has imposed certain\nconditions including prescription of time limit under section  16(2) and (4) of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017\nwhich shall be fulfilled by the taxpayer before laying a claim for refund of ITC. Therefore, he would argue\nneither the condition s mentioned in section 16(2) nor the time limit in Section 16(4) can be attributed  to be\nillegal or unconstitu tional. He would submit, assuming ITC as a legal right, still the legislature has a right to\nimpose time limit for claiming such right as has been done through Indian Limitation Act, 1863 whereunder ,\neven against the statutory right of filing appeal, time prescription was made and therefore, ITC claim which\neven if placed on the pedestal of a legal right, still cannot claim exemption. To buttress the said argument, he\nplaced reliance on Willowood Chemica ls (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  2018  SCC OnLine Guj 4833/ [2018] 98\ntaxmann.com 100/2018 (19) GSTL 228 (Guj.) .\nHe would further submit that the operat ive sphere of article 14 and 19(1)( g) and 300A  of the Constitution of\nIndia is quite distinc t from that of section 16(4) of the APGST/CGST Act, 2017 and therefore, even in the\nwildest imagination one cannot authoritatively claim the latter has infringed the former . Learned AG would\nexpatiate that in order to strike down a provision in a statute to be violati ve of Article 14, it must be\nestablished that the said provision is arbitrary and negated the equality . Said arbitrariness must be manifest\nfrom the provision impugned. In this context he relied upon State of Tamil Nadu  v. K. Shyam Sunder  (2011) 8\nSCC 737. Learned Advocate General while supporting the exaction of interest and 100% of penalty on the tax\ndue, argued that the petitioner alone was not the sufferer of COVID-19 pandemi c prevalent circumstances and\nother traders of his ilk who were under similar circumstances have filed their returns in due time and therefore\nthe petitioner cannot be given special treatment. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n10. Court's Findings. \u2014The precise reaso n why the Departm ent proposed to levy tax, penalty and applicable\ninterest invoking powers under section 74(1) of the APGST Act, 2017 is that the petitioner filed monthly\nreturns belatedly as mentioned below , after due date prescribed under section 39 of the APGST Act, 2017 for\nthe month of September 2020 and thereby claimed ITC of Rs. 4,78,626/- irregularly in contravention of the\nprovisions under section 16(4) of the APGST Act/CGST Act read with section 20 of the IGST Act, 2017:\nSl.\nNo.Year Tax\nperiodGSTR 3B\nRETURNPrescribed date for filing for the month\nof succeeding year SeptemberAmount of ITC irr egularly\nclaimed under all acts\nDue date\nfor filingDate\noffiling\n1. 2019-\n20Mar\n202030-6-\n202027-11-\n202020-10-2020 4,78,626\n(a) The petitioner was served with show cause notice, for which he filed written objections and according\nto the Department, personal hearing was accorded on 2-3-2022. The impugned assessment order dated\n14-3-2022 would show , the petitioner had taken about 10 factual and legal objections which were\ndiscussed and rejected by 1st respondent in the impugned order by confirming the demand of Rs.\n11,24,994/- comprising (i) tax of Rs. 4,78,62 6/- (ii) interest of RS.1,6 7,742/- and (iii) penalty of Rs.\n4,78,626/-\n(b) Of the objections raised, objection Nos.6 and 7 are important, the substance of which is that in view\nof the non-obstante  clause employed in Section 16(2) of the APGST Act/CGST Act, it would have\nprimacy over section 16(4) of those Acts, meaning thereby , when the return submitted by the petitioner is\naccepted with late fee, the time limit prescribed for claiming ITC can be safely ignored and ITC can be\nallowed on verification of relevant particulars and documents furnished along with return. This argument\nwas reject ed by the 1st respondent on the prime ground that the collection of late fee can never be an\nimmune for other aspects such as output tax payment, demand for interest on belated payment as well as\nclaiming of input tax credit (ITC) beyond the stipulated time period. In other words, the collection of late\nfee exclusively relates to the issue of belated filing of return but not else. It would not preclude the action\nprescribed under section 61 to 74 of SGST/CGST Acts r/w section 20 of IGST Act. The petitioner has\nnot filed the return within the prescribe d time of 30-6-2020 for the month of March, 2020 nor filed the\nreturn on or before 20-10-2020 which was the prescribed time for filing the return relating to the month\nof Septem ber of succeeding year. The 1st respondent thus observed that the petitioner can claim ITC\nsubject to fulfillment of conditions stipulated in section 16 of SGST/CGST Act r/w section 20 of IGST\nAct and the claim made through GSTR 3B return filed after prescribed date was not valid. In the light of\nabove diverse contentions the concept of ITC and relevant provisions have to be perused.\n11. The input tax credit owed its genesis to the legislative measure of introducing APGST/CGST Acts to\neradicate cascading effect of taxes which  existed under Excise, VAT and Service tax. Input Tax is the tax paid\nby the buyer on purchase of goods or services. Such tax which is paid by the purchaser can be reduced from\nthe liability payable on outward supplie s known as Output Tax. Precisely input tax credit is the tax reduced\nfrom output tax payable on account of sale. For instance 'A' purchased goods worth Rs. 18,000/- on which he\npaid GST of Rs. 3,240/- at 18%. Then he sold goods worth Rs. 22,000/- whereon GST payable @ 18% is Rs.\n3,960/-. Thus the net GST payable after availing input tax credit is Rs. 720/- (3,960-3,240). In that manner the\nassessee gets the ITC. Under section (2)(63) of APGST Act, 2017 an Input Tax Credit means the credit of\nInput T ax.\n12. Be that as it may, the controversy revolves around the interpretation of Section 16 (2) and (4) of APGST\nAct/CGST Act. Before examining the effect of Section 16(2) and (4) of APGST/CGST Act it is relevant to\nruminate the cardinal principle of interp retation. In Reserve Bank of India  v. Peerless General Finance and\nInvestment Co. Ltd.  AIR 1987 SC 1023 = MANU/SC/0073/1987 the Apex Court observed thus:\n\"Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may\nwell say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour . Neither can be ignored. Both are\nimportant. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A\nstatute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowl edge, the statute must be\nread, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If\na statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker , provided by\nsuch conte xt, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different\nthan when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we\nmust look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word\nis meant and design ed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word\nof a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and\neverything is in its place.\"\n13. Now it is pertinent to extract section 16(2) and (4) of APGST/CGST Act. They are:\nSection 16 of APGST Act reads thus:\"16. Eligibility and conditions for taking input tax credit.\u2014 (1) Every registered person shall, subject to\nsuch conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed and in the manner specified in section 49, be\nentitled to take credit of input tax charged on any supply of goods or services or both to him which are\nused or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of his business and the said amount shall be\ncredited to the electronic credit ledger of such person.\n(2) Notwithstanding  anything contained in this section, no registered person shall be entitled to the credit\nof any input tax in respect of any supply of goods or services or both to him unless,-\n(a) he is in possession of a tax invoice or debit note issued by a supplier registered under this Act, or such\nother taxpaying documents as may be prescribed;\n(b) he has received the goods or services or both.\n[Explanation .\u2014For the purposes of this clause, it shall be deemed that the registered person has received\nthe goods or , as the case may be, services-\n(i) where the goods are delivered by the supplier to a recipient or any other person on the direction of\nsuch regis tered person, whether acting as an agent or otherwise, before or during movement of goods,\neither by way of transfer of documents of title to goods or otherwise;\n(ii) where the services  are provided by the supplier to any person on the direction of and on account of\nsuch registered person.]\n(c) subject to the provisions of [Section 41 or Section 43A], the tax charged in respect of such supply has\nbeen actually paid to the Government, either in cash or through utilization of input tax credit admissible\nin respect of the said supply; and\n(d) he has furnished the return under section 39:\nProvided that where the good s against an invoic e are received in lots or installments, the registered\nperson shall be entitled to take credit upon receipt of the last lot or installment:\nProvisional Reversal of ITC\nProvided further that where a recipient fails to pay to the supplier of goods or services or both, other\nthan the supplies on which tax is payabl e on reverse charge basis, the amount towards the value of supply\nalong with tax payable thereon within a period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of issue of\ninvoice by the supplier , an amount equal to the input tax credit availed by the recipient shall be added to\nhis output tax liability , along with interest thereon, in such manner as may be prescribed:\nProvided also that the recipient shall be entitled to avail of the credit of input tax on payment made by\nhim of the amount towards the value of supply of goods or services or both along with tax payable\nthereon.\n(3) Where the registered person has claimed depreciation on the tax component of the cost of capital\ngoods and plant and machinery under the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the input tax credit on\nthe said tax component shall not be allowed.\n(4) A registered person shall not be entitled to take input tax credit in respect of any invoice or debit note\nfor supply of goods or services or both after the due date of furnishing of the return under section 39 for\nthe month of September following the end of financial year to which such invoice or invoice relating to\nsuch debit note pertains or furnishing of the relevant annual return, whichever is earlier:\"\n14. Then Section 16 of CGST Act reads thus:\n\"16. Eligibility and conditions for taking input tax credit.\u2014(1) Every register ed person shall, subject to\nsuch conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed and in the manner specified in section 49, be\nentitled to take credit of input tax charged on any supply of goods or services or both to him which are\nused or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of his business and the said amount shall be\ncredited to the electronic credit ledger of such person.\n(2) Notwithstanding  anything contained in this section, no registered person shall be entitled to the credit\nof any input tax in respect of any supply of goods or services or both to him unless,-(a) he is in possession of a tax invoice or debit note issued by a supplier registered under this Act, or such\nother taxpaying documents as may be prescribed;\n[(aa) the details of the invoice or debit note referred to in clause (a) has been  furnished by the supplier in\nthe statement of outward supplies and such details have been communicated  to the recipient of such\ninvoice or debit note in the manner specified under section 37]1\n(b) he has received the goods or services or both.\n[Explanation .\u2014For the purposes of this clause, it shall be deemed that the registered person has received\nthe goods or , as the case may be, services-\n(i) where the goods are delivered by the supplier to a recipient or any other person on the direction of\nsuch regis tered person, whether acting as an agent or otherwise, before or during movement of goods,\neither by way of transfer of documents of title to goods or otherwise;\n(ii) where the services  are provided by the supplier to any person on the direction of and on account of\nsuch registered person;]2\n[(ba) the details of input tax credit in respec t of the said supply communicated to such registered person\nunder section 38 has not been restricted;]3\n(c) subject to the provisions of [section 41]4 [***]5, the tax charged in respect of such supply has been\nactually paid to the Government, either in cash or through utilisation of input tax credit admissible in\nrespect of the said supply; and\n(d) he has furnished the return under section 39:\nProvided that where the goods against an invoice are received in lots or instalments, the registered person\nshall be entitled to take credit upon receipt of the last lot or instalment:\nProvided  Further that where a recipient fails to pay to the supplier of goods or services or both, other\nthan the supplies on which tax is payabl e on reverse charge basis, the amount towards the value of supply\nalong with tax payable thereon within a period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of issue of\ninvoice by the supplier , an amount equal to the input tax credit availed by the recipient shall be added to\nhis output tax liability , along with interest thereon, in such manner as may be prescribed:\nProvided Also  that the recipient shall be entitled to avail of the credit of input tax on payment made by\nhim of the amount towards the value of supply of goods or services or both along with tax payable\nthereon.\n(3) Where the registered person has claimed depreciation on the tax component of the cost of capital\ngoods and plant and machinery under the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961), the input\ntax credit on the said tax component shall not be allowed.\n(4) A registered person shall not be entitled to take input tax credit in respect of any invoice or debit note\nfor supply of goods or services or both after the [thirtieth day of November]6 following the end of\nfinancial year to which such invoice or [****]7 debit note pertains or furnishing of the relevant annual\nreturn, whichever is earlier:\n[Provided  that the registered  person shall be entitled to take input tax credit after the due date of\nfurnishing of the return under section 39 for the month of September , 2018 till the due date of furnishing\nof the return under the said section for the month of March, 2019 in respect of any invoice or invoice\nrelating to such debit note for supply of goods or services or both made during the financial year 2017-\n18, the details of which have been uploaded by the supplier under sub-section (1) of section 37 till the\ndue date for furnishing the details under sub-section (1) of said section for the month of March, 2019.]8\"\n15. On a careful scrutin y, section 16 of the APGST Act, 2017 prescribes the eligibility and conditions for a\nGST assessee to claim credit of Input Tax which was charged on any supply of goods or services or both\nwhich were used or intended to be used in the course of furtherance of his busin ess. Precisely while section 16\nsub-section (2) prescribes the eligibility criteria which is sine qua non for claiming ITC, sub-section (3) and\n(4) impose conditions or limitation for claiming ITC. In other words, even if an assessee passes basiceligibility criteria imposed under section 16(2), still he will not be entitled to claim ITC if his case falls within\nthe limitations prescribed under sub-sections (3) and (4).\n(a) Pithily stating the eligibility criteria prescribed under sub-section (2) is thus:\n(i) The assessee shall be in possession of tax invoice or debit note or such other taxpaying documents as\nissued by a registered supplier;\n(ii) The assessee has physically received the goods or services or both. Provided, where the goods against\ninvoices are received in lots or instalmen ts, assessee shall be entitled to take ITC upon receipt of a last lot\nor instalment;\n(iii) The tax char ged in respect of such supply has been actually paid to the Government;\n(iv) The assessee has furnished the return under section 39;\n(b) Then sub-section (3) imposes conditio n on ITC saying that where the assesse e claimed depreciation\non the tax component of the cost of capital goods and plant & machinery under the Income-tax Act,\n1961, then ITC shall not be allowed on such tax component.\n(c) Then sub-section (4) prescribes another limitation for claiming ITC. It says that an assessee shall not\nbe entitled to take ITC in respect of any invoice or debit note for supply of good s or services or both after\ndue date of furnishing of return under section 39 for the month of Septemb er following the end of\nfinancial year, to which such invoices or debit note pertains or furnishing of the relevant annual returns\nwhichever is earlier . In other words, if an assessee fails to furnish the returns within the time as stated\nsupra , he will not be entitled to claim ITC.\n16. It should be noted section 16 of CGST Act, 2017 is in pari materia  with section 16 of APGST Act, 2017\nwith minor differences  which are not much relevant in the present context. Hence this section needs no much\nelaboration.\n17. When the contentio n of the petitioner that in view of non obstante  clause, Section 16(2) overrides Sub\nsection (4) is examined, no doubt section 16 (2) starts with a non obstante  clause as \"Notwithstanding\nanything contained in this section\". The general purpose of a non obstante  clause has been explained in a\nplethora of decisions.\n(i) In Union of India  v. G.M. Kokil [1984] (Supp) SCR 196 = MANU/SC/0210/1984 it was observed\nthus:\n\"It is well-known that a non obstane clause is a legislative device which is usually employed to give\noverriding ef fect to certain provisions over some contrary provisions that may be found either in the same\nenactment or some other enactment, that is to say, to avoid the operation and effect of all contrary\nprovisions.\"\n(ii) In Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao v. Ashalata S. Guram  AIR 1987 SC 117 = MANU/SC/0531/1986\nthe Apex Court held:\n\"69. A clause beginning with the expression \"notwithstanding anything contain ed in this Act or in some\nparticular provision in the Act or in some particular Act or in any law for the time being in force, or in\nany contract\" is more often than not appended to a section in the beginning with a view to give the\nenacting part of the section in case of conflict an overriding effect over the provision of the Act or the\ncontract mentioned in the non-obstante  clause. It is equivalent to saying that in spite of the provision of\nthe Act or any other Act mentioned in the  non-obstante  clause or any contract or document mentioned the\nenactment following  it will have its full operation or that the provisions embraced in the non-obstante\nclause would not be an impediment for an operation of the enactment\"\n(iii) In R.S Raghunath  v. State of Karnataka  AIR 1992 SC 81 = MANU/SC/0159/1980 the Apex Court\nobserved:\n\"22. On a conspectus of the above authorities it emer ges that the non obstante  clause is appended  to a\nprovision with a view to give the enacting part of the provision an overriding ef fect in case of a conflict. \"\n(iv) In Maru Ram  v. Union of India  AIR 1980 SC 2147 =MANU/SC/0159/ 1980 the Apex Court referred\nthe ratio in Godse's case MANU/SC/0156/1961 and observed thus:\"20. We cannot agree with counsel that the non obstante  provision impliedly sustains. It is elem entary\nthat a non obstante  tail should not wag a statutory dog (see for similar idea, \"The Interpretation and\nApplication of Statute's by Reed Dicker -son, p, 10). This Court has held way back in 1952 in Aswini\nKumar Chose, MANU/SC/0022/1952 : [1953] 4 SCR1 that a non obstante  clause cannot whittle down\nthe wide import of the principal part. The enacting part is clear and the non obstante  clause cannot cut\ndown its scope\"\n(v) In A.G Varadarajulu  v. State of Tamilnadu  reported in MANU/SC/0232/1998: (1998) 4 SCC 231,\nobserved that it is well settled that while dealing with a non-obstante  clause under which the legislature\nwants to give overr iding effect to a section, the court must try to find out the extent to which the\nlegislature had intended to give one provision overriding effect over anoth er provision. The Bench\nreferred to the principle in the Constitution Bench decision in Madhav Rao Scindia  v. Union of India\nMANU/SC/0050/1970 : (1971) 1 SCC 85 wherein it was held that the non-obstante  clause was a very\npotent clause intended to exclude every consideration arising from other provisi ons of the same statute or\nother statute but \"for that reason alone we must determine the scope\" of that provision strictly . When the\nsection containing the said clause does not refer to any particular provisions which it intends to override,\nbut refers to the provisions of the statute generally , it is not permissible to hold that it excludes the whole\nAct and stands alone by itself (See p. 236).\n(vi) In ICICI Bank Ltd. v. SIDCO Leathers Ltd., reported in MANU/SC/2337/2006: [2006] 10 SCC\n452/[2006] 67 SCL 383 (SC) , that the wide amplitude of a non-obstante  clause must be kept confined to\nthe legislative policy and it can be given effect to, to the extent the Parliament intended and not beyond\nthe same and that in construing the provisions of a non-obstante  clause, it was necessary to determine the\npurpose and object for which it was enacted (See page 465-6).\n(vii) In Central Bank of India  v. State of Kerala  reported in MANU/SC/0306/2009 : (2009) 4 SCC 94,\nthis Court reiterated that while interpreting a non-obstante  clause the court is required to find out the\nextent to which the legislature intended to give it an overriding ef fect.\n18. The above jurimetr ical jurisprudence expounds that a non obstante  clause is a legislative device usually\nemployed in a statute to give overriding effect to certain provisions over some other contradictory provisions\nin the same or other statute. The Court shall try to find out the extent to which the legislature had intended to\ngive the overriding effect to the enacting  part of the provision succeeding to the non obstante  clause over rest\nof the provision. Now the pertinent question is whether section 16 sub-section (2) overrides the rest of the\nsection particularly sub-section (4).\n19. When analyzed, section 16(2) shall not appear to be a provision which allows input tax credit, rather ITC\nenabling provision is section 16(1). On the other hand, section 16(2) restricts the credit which is otherwise\nallowed to only such cases where conditions prescribed in it are satisfied. Therefore, section 16(2) in terms\nonly overrides the provision which enables the ITC i.e., section 16(1). This is evident from the manner in\nwhich Section 16(2) is couched. The non obstante  clause in section 16(2) is followed by a negative sentence\n\"no registered person shall be entitled to the credit of any input tax in respe ct of any supply of goods or\nservices or both to him unless\". This negative sentence pellucidly tells that unless the conditions mentioned in\nsection 16(2) are satisfied, no credit will be eligible. This stipulation manifests that section 16(2) is not an\nenabling provision but a restricting provision. What it restricts is the eligibility which was otherwise given U/s\n16(1).\n(a) It should be noted, when a non obstante  clause is a mere restricting provision, an interpretation that\nthe other restricting provisions will not have effect or that the restricting provision will restrict other\nrestricting provisions cannot be accepted for the reason that there is no contradiction between the\nrestricting clause followed by  non obstante  and other restricting provisions.\nIn R.S. Raghunath's  case ( supra 21 ) the Apex Court held thus:\n\"11. ** **. The non-obstante  clause is sometimes  appended to a section or a rule in the beginning with a\nview to give the enacting part of that section or rule in case of conflict, an overriding effect over the\nprovisions or act mentioned in that clause. Such a clause is usually used in the provision to indicate that\nthe said provision should prevail despite anything to the contrary in the provision mentioned in such non-\nobstante  clause.\"Hence unless such clear inconsistency is established, overriding effect cannot be given over other provisions.\nIn the present case both Section 16(2) and (4) are two different  restricting provisions, the former provi ding\neligibility conditions  and the later imposing time limit. However , both these provisions have no inconsistency\nbetween them. In R.S. Raghunath, the Apex Court further observed thus:\n\"But the  non-obstante  clause need not necessarily and always be co-extensive with the operative part so\nas to have  the effect of cutting down the clear terms of an enactment and if the words of the enactment\nare clear and are capable of a clear interpretation on a plain and grammatical construction of the words\nthe non-obstante  clause cannot cut down the construction and restrict the scope of its operation. In such\ncases the non-obstante  clause has to be read as clarifying the whole position and must be understood to\nhave been incorporated in the enactment by the Legislature by way of abundant caution and not by way\nof limiting the ambit and scope of the Special Rules.\"\nFurther , the influence of a  non obstante  clause has to be considered on the basis  of the context also in which it\nis used. Therefore, section 16(4) being a non-contradictory provision and capable of clear interpretation, will\nnot be overridden by non obstante  provision u/s 16(2). As already stated  supra  16(4) only prescribes time\nrestriction to avail credit. For this reason, the ar gument that 16(2) overrides 16(4) is not correct.\nThus in substance section 16(1) is an enabling clause for ITC; 16(2) subjects such entitlement to certain\nconditions; section 16(3) and (4) further  restrict the entitlement given u/s 16(1). That being the scheme of the\nprovision, it is out of context to contend that one of the restricting provisions overrides other two restrictions.\nThe issue can be looked into otherwise also. If really the legislature has no intention to impose time limitation\nfor availing ITC, there was no necessity to insert a specific provision U/s 16(4) and to further intend to\noverride it through section 16(2) which is a futile exercise.\n20. Then  the next conte ntion of the petition er is that since Form GSTR-3B return of March, 2020 filed on 27-\n11-2020 by the petitioner was accepted  with a late fee of Rs. 10,000/-, such acceptance will exonerate the\ndelay in filing return u/s 16(4) and there fore along with his return, the ITC claim shall also be considered. In\nour consid ered view  this argument holds  no much force for the reason that the conditions stipulated in section\n16(2) and (4) are mutually different  and both will opera te independently . Therefore, mere filing of the return\nwith a delay fee will not act as a springboard for claiming ITC. As rightly argued by learned Advocate\nGeneral, collection of late fee is only for the purpose of admitting the returns for verification of taxable\nturnover of the petitioner but not for consideration of ITC. Such a statutory limitation cannot be stifled by\ncollecting late fee.\n21. The further argument of the petitioner that section 16(4) of APGST/CGST Act, 2017 violates article 14,\n19(1)( g) and 300-A of the Constitution of India  is concerned, the said argument has no vitality for the reason,\nfirstly the ITC is a mere concession/rebate/benefit but not a statutory or constitutional right and therefore\nimposing conditions including time limitation for availi ng the said concessi on will not amount to violation of\nconstitution or any statute and secondly , as rightly argued by learned Advocate General, the operative spheres\nof Section (16) and constitutional provisions under article 14, 19(1)( g) and 300-A are different  and hence\ninfringement does not arise. That, by nature ITC is a concession/rebate/benefit but not a statutory right has\nbeen reiterated in a thicket of decisions.\nIn Jayam and Co.'s case (supra 5) the Apex Court with reference to Section (19) of Tamilnadu Value\nAdded T ax Act, 2016 held that ITC is a concession. The Apex Court observed thus:\n \"11.** ** **\nFrom the aforesaid scheme of section 19 following significant aspects emer ge:\n(a) ITC is a form of concession provided by the Legislature. It is not admissible to all kinds of sales and\ncertain specified sales are specifically excluded.\n(b) Concession of ITC is available on certain conditions mentioned in this Section.\n(c) One of the most important conditions is that in order to enable the dealer to claim ITC it has to\nproduce original tax invoice, completed in all respect, evidencing the amount of input tax.\n12. It is trite law that whenever concess ion is given by statute or notification etc. the conditions thereof\nare to be strictly complied with in order to avail such concession. Thus, it is not the right of the 'dealers'\nto get the benefit of ITC but it is a concession granted by virtue of Section 19. As a fortiori, conditionsspecified in Section 10 must be fulfilled . In that hue, we find that Section 10 makes original tax invoice\nrelevant for the purpose of claiming tax. Therefore, under the scheme of the VAT Act, it is not\npermissible for the dealers to argue that the price as indicated in the tax invoice should not have been\ntaken into consideration but the net purchase price after discount is to be the basis.\"\n22. In ALD Auto motive (P.) Ltd.'s  case (supra 7) section 19(11) of Tamilnadu VAT Act, 2006 which imposes\ntime limit for claiming input tax credit was challenged on the ground that it was arbitrary and violative of\nArticles 14 and 19(1)( g) of the Constitution of India. IN that context while upholding the time prescription\nU/s 19(1 1) of the said Act the Apex Court on the following aspects observed thus:\n\"36. ( i) Interpr etation of taxing statutes. \u2014 This Court had the occasion to consider the Karnataka Value\nAdded T ax Act, 2013 in State of Karnataka  v. M.K. Agr o Tech. (P .) Ltd.  This Court held that it is a settled\nproposition of law that taxing statutes are to be interpreted literally and further it is in the domain of the\nlegislature as to how much tax credit is to be given under what circumstances. The following was stated\nin para 32: (SCC p. 223)\n\"32. Fourt hly, the entire scheme of the KVAT Act is to be kept in mind and Section 17 is to be applied in\nthat context. Sunflower oil cake is subject to input tax. The legislature, howe ver, has incorporated the\nprovision, in the form of Section 10, to give tax credit in respect of such goods which are used as\ninputs/raw material for manufacturing other goods. Rationale behind the same is simple. When the\nfinished product, after manufacture, is sold, V AT would be again payable thereon. This V AT is payable on\nthe price at which such goods are sold, costing whereof is done keeping in view  the expenses involved in\nthe manufacture of such goods plus the profits which the manufacturer intends to earn. Insofar as costing\nis concerned, element of expenses incurred on raw material would be included. In this manner , when the\nfinal produ ct is sold and the VAT paid, component of raw material would be included again. Keeping in\nview this objective, the legislature has intended to give tax credit to some extent. However , how much tax\ncredit is to be given and under what circumstances, is the domain of the legislat ure and the courts are not\nto tinker with the same.\"\n\"34.(ii) Natur e of input tax credit.\u2014The input credit is in the nature of benefit/concession extended to the\ndealer under the statutory scheme. The concession can be received by the beneficiary only as per the\nscheme of the statut e. Reference is made to the judgment of this Court in Godr ej & Boyce Mfg. Co. (P.)\nLtd. v. CST. Rules 41 and 42 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1959 provided for the set-of f of the\npurchase tax. This Court held that the rule-making authority can provide curtailment while extending the\nconcession.\"\n37 The judgment on which the learned Advocate General of Tamil Nadu had placed much reliance i.e.\nJayam & Co. v. Commr . is the judgment which is relevant for the present case. In the above case, this\nCourt had the occasi on to interpret the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006, Section\n19(20), section 3(2) and section 3(3). Validity of Section 19(20) was under challenge in the said case.\nThis Court after noticing the scheme under section 19 noticed the following aspects in para 11: (SCC p.\n134)\n\"11. From the aforesaid scheme of Section 19 the following significant aspects emer ge:\n(a) ITC is a form of concession provided by the legislature. It is not admissible to all kinds of sales and\ncertain specified sales are specifically excluded.\n(b) Concession of ITC is available on certain conditions mentioned in this section.\n(c) One of the most important condition is that in order to enable the dealer to claim ITC it has to produce\noriginal tax invoice, completed in all respect, evidencing the amount of input tax.\n38. This Court further held that it is a trite law that whenever concession is given by a statute the\nconditions thereof are to be strictly complied with in order to avail such concession.\"\n\"39. ( iii) Constitutional validity of section 19.\u2014The constitutiona l validity of section 19(20) was upheld.\nThe above  decision is a clear authority with proposition that input tax credit is admissible only as per\nconditions enumera ted under section 19 of the Tamil Nadu Value Adde d Tax Act, 2006. The\ninterpretation put up by this Court on sections 3(2) and 3(3) and section 19(2) is fully attracted while\nconsidering the same provisions of sections 3(2) and 3(3) and the provision of section 19(11) of the Act.The statut ory scheme delineated by section 19(11) neither can be said to be arbitrary nor can be said to\nviolate the right guaranteed to the dealer under Article 19(1)( g) of the Constitution.\"\n\"40.( iv)With regard to time prescription laid under section 19(11).\u2014The alternative submission pressed\nby the learned couns el for the appellant was that section 19(11) cannot be held to be mandatory and it is\nonly a directory provision, non-compliance with which cannot be ground of denial of input tax credit to\nthe appella nt. The conditions under which input tax credit is to be given are all enumerated in Section 19\nas noticed above. The condition under which the concession and benefit is given is always to be strictly\nconstrued. In event, it is accepted that ther e is no time period for claiming  input tax credit as contained in\nSection 19(11), the provision becomes too flexible and gives rise to large number of difficulties including\ndifficulty in verification of claim of input credit. Taxing statutes contain self-contained scheme of levy,\ncomputation and collection of tax. The time under which a return is to be filed for the purpose of\nassessment of the tax cannot be dependent on the will of a dealer . The use of the word \"shall\" in Section\n19(11) does not admit to any other interpr etation except that the submission of input claimed cannot be\nbeyond the time prescribed.\"\n(Emphasis Supplied )\n23. In USA Agencies'  case (supra 6) the challenge before High Court of Madras was the vires of Section\n19(11) of T amilnadu V AT Act, 2006 which prescribed modalities and time frame as regards availment of input\ntax credit. The High Court of Madras held thus:\n\" 38. Provision for availing concession is to be strictly construed and followed. \"Input Tax Credit\", which\nis in the natur e of concession or indulgence, could be availed only in the manner prescribed under\nsection 19. Law is well settled that the person, who claims exemption or concessional rate, must obey and\nfulfill the mandatory requir ements exactly . Unless there is strict compliance with the provisions of the\nstatute, the register ed Dealer is not entitled to claim \"Input Tax Credit\". Apart from section 19 of TN VAT\nAct, there is no independent right to claim \"Input Tax Credit\". When section 19(11) stipulates time frame\nfor availment of \"Input Tax Credit\", the register ed Dealer must strictly follow the mandatory\nrequir ements of the pr ovision.\n(Emphasis Supplied )\n39. The availment of Input Tax Credit is creature of Statute. The concessio n of Input Tax Credit is\ngranted by the State Government so that the beneficiaries of the concession are not required to pay the\ntax or duty which they are otherwise liable to pay under TN V AT Act. While so extending the concession,\nit is open to the Legislature to impose conditions. Section 19(11) is one such condition imposed making it\nmandatory for the registered Dealer to claim Input Tax Credit before the end of the financial year or\nbefore ninety days from the date of purchase, whichever is later. The entitlement to claim Input Tax\nCredit is created by TN VAT Act and the terms on which Input Tax Credit can be claimed must be strictly\nobserved.\"\nRegarding constitutional validity of fiscal legislation, the Court further observed thus:\n\"61.Constitutional Validity of Fiscal Legislation. \u2014When there is a challenge to the Constitutional\nvalidity of the provisions of a Statute, Court exercising power of judicial review  must be conscious of the\nlimitation of judicial intervention, particularly , in matters relating to the legitimacy of the economic or\nfiscal legis lation. While enacting fiscal legislation, the Legislature is entitled to a great deal of latitude.\nThe Court  would interfere only where a clear infraction of a Constitutional provision is established. The\nburden is on the person, who attacks the Constitutional validity of a statute, to establish clear\ntransgression of Constitutional principle.\"\n24. In Willowood Chemicals (P.) Ltd. (supra  8) before Gujarat High Court, inter alia the rule 117 of CGST\nRules which prescribed the time limit for making declaration of available tax credits as on 30-6-2017 was\nchallenged as ultra vires to the Constitution and it was contended such time limit shou ld be read as directory\nand not mandatory . The High Court of Gujarat held thus:\n\"50. While the entire tax structure within the country was thus being replaced by a new framework, it was\nnecessary for the Legislature to make transitional provisions. Section 140 of the CGST Act, which is a\ntransitional provision, essentially preserves all taxes paid or suffered by a dealer . Credit thereof is to be\ngiven in electronic credit register under the new statute, only subject to making necessary declarations in\nprescribed format within the prescribed time. As noted, sub-section (1) of section 164 of the CGST ActSBauthorizes the Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act on recommendations\nof the Council. Sub-section (2) of Section 164 further provides that without prejudice to the generality of\nthe provis ions of sub-section (1), the Government could also make rules for all, or any of the matters,\nwhich by this Act are required to be or may be prescribed or in respect of whic h, provisions are to be or\nmay be made by the rules. Combined effect of the powers conferred to subordinate Legislature under\nsub-sections (1) and (2) of section 164 of the CGST Act would convince us that the prescription of time\nlimit unde r sub-rule  (1) of rule 117 of the CGST Rules is not ultra vires the Act. Likewise, such\nprescription of time limit cannot be stated to be either unreasonable or arbitrary . When the entire tax\nstructure of the country is being shifted from earlier framework to a new one, there has to be a degree of\nfinality on claims, credits, transfers of such credits and all issues related theret o. The petitioners cannot\nargue that without any reference to the time limit, such credits should be allowed to be transferred during\nthe proces s of migration. Any such view would hamper the effective implem entation of the new tax\nstructure and would also lead to endless disputes and litigations. As noted in case of USA Agencies\n(supra ), the Supreme Court had upheld the vires of a statutory provision contained in the Tamil Nadu\nValue Added Tax Act which provided that the dealer would have to make a claim for input tax credit\nbefore the end of the financial year or before ninety days of purchase; whichever is later. The vires was\nupheld observing that the Legislature consciously wanted to set up the time frame for availmen t of the\ninput tax credit. Such conditions therefore must be strictly complied with. Thus , merely because the rule\nin question prescribes a time frame for making a declaration, such provision cannot necessarily be held to\nbe directory in nature and must depend on the context of the statutory scheme.\"\n25. Though above decisions deal with ITC claim related to the concerned State laws, however since concept\nof ITC is one and the same, those decisions will equally apply to the case on hand. Thus, it is clear that ITC\nbeing a concession /benefit/rebate, the legislature is within its competency to impose certain conditions,\nincluding time prescripti on for availing such right and the same cannot be challenged on the ground of\nviolation of Constitutional provisions. As rightly argued by learned Advocate General, the operative spheres\nof those Articles is different  from that of Section 16. In order to establish legislative arbitrariness, it must be\nproved that the action was not reasonable or done capriciously or at pleasure, non rational, not done or acting\naccording to reason or judgment but depending on the will alone. Then only it can be held to have violated\nArticle 14 of the Constitution  vide K. Syam sundar (supra 9) .\n26. We have gone through the citations relied upon by the petitioners. They are mostly facts oriented decisions\nwherein it was observed that when the delay for filing returns was properly explained, penalty was not\nimpossible. They are not touching upon the vires of section 16 of APGST/CGST Act.\n27. Thus on a conspectus of facts and law , we hold:\n(i) Point No. 1: The time limit prescribed for claiming ITC u/s 16(4) of APGST Act/CGST Act, 2017\nis not violative of articles 14, 19(1)( g) and 300-A of the Constitution of India.\n(ii) Point No. 2:  Section 16(2) of APGST/CGST Act, 2017 has no overriding effect on section 16(4) of\nthe said Act as both are not contradictory with each other . They will operate independently .\n(iii) Point No. 3: Mere acceptance of Form GSTR-3B returns with late fee will not exonerate the delay\nin claiming ITC beyond the period specified u/s 16(4) of APGST/CGST Act, 2017.\nPOINT No. 4:\nWith regard to these contentions, a perusal of impugned Assessment Order dated 14-2-2022 passed by the 1st\nrespondent shows that the present contentions that the notice was not issued  in proper form and that no\nopportunity was granted for hearing etc., which were taken in objections 1 to 10 of the reply by the petitioners\nwere vividly discussed and rejected by the 1st respondent. Hence we see no force in the present contentions.\n28. Thus on a conspectus of facts and law and in view of findings in Points 1 to 4, the writ petition is\ndismissed.

Hear d Sri Vemiredd y Bhaskar Reddy , learned counsel for the petitioner , and Sri Y.N. Vivekananda, learned\nGovernment Pleader for respondents.\n6. Broadly , there are two contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner . They are:\n(1) Fourth respondent herein in the impugned orders of provisional attachment did not record  anything\nwith regard to the formation of opinion or subjective satisfaction and the same is contrary to the\nprovisions of section 83 of the Act.\n(2) As on the date of the orders of provisional attachment, there were no proceedings pending under\nsection 67 of the Act nor any proceedings have been initiated either under section 73 or 74 of the Act.\n7. In support of his submissions and contentions, learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on a\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Radha Krishan Industries  v. State of Himachal Pradesh\n[2021] 127 taxmann.com 26/86 GST 665 and the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Anjani\nImpex  v. State of Gujarat [2020] 122 taxmann.com 299 .\n8. On the contrary , learned Government Pleader , strongly resisting the Writ Petition, contends that there is\nabsolutely no illegality nor there exists any procedural infirmity in the impugned action and, in the absence of\nthe same, invocation of the jurisdictio n of this Court, under article 226 of the Constitution of India, is\nimpermissible. It is further submitted by the learned Government Pleader that the fourth respondent herein,\nafter recording  valid reasons , in the Note File, with an intention to protect the interest of the Governmen t\nrevenue, issued the impugned provisional order of attachment of the bank accou nts of the petitioner . It is also\nthe submi ssion of the learned Govern ment Pleader that there is absolutely no necessity to mention the\nparticulars of all the reasons  in the provisional orders of attachment and the same would be evident from the\nlanguage employed in section 83 of the Act and rule 159 of the Rules framed thereunder .\n9. In order to consider the issue in the present Writ Petition, reference to the provisions of section 83 of the\nAct is necessary and expedient. Section 83 of the Act reads as follows:\n\"Provisional attachment to protect revenue in certain cases. \u2014(1) Where during  the pendency of any\nproceedings under section 62 or section 63 or section 64 or section 67 or section 73 or section 74, the\nCommissioner is of the opinion that for the purpose of protecting the interest of the Government revenue,\nit is neces sary so to do, he may, by order in writing attach provisionally any property , including bank\naccount, belonging to the taxable person in such manner as may be prescribed. (2) Every such provisional\nattachment shall cease to have effect after the expiry of a period of one year from the date of the order\nmade under sub-section (1)\".\n10. A reading of the above provision of law makes it very much evident that the Commissioner is empowered\nto pass an order of provisional attachment during the pendency of any proceedi ngs under section 62 or 63 or\n64 or 67 or 73 or section 74 of the Act, if the Commissioner is of the opinion that, for the purpose of\nprotecting the interest of the Government revenue, the same is essential. The scope and ambit of the said\nprovision of law fell for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Radha KrishanIndustries  (supra ) and the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at paragraphs 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54 to 56 and 59, held in\nthe following manner:\n\"48. Now in this backdrop, it becomes necessary to emphasize that before the Commissioner can levy a\nprovisional attachme nt, there must be a formation of \"the opinion\" and that it is necessary \"so to do\" for\nthe purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue. The power to levy a provisional\nattachment is draconian in nature. By the exercise of the power , a property belonging to the taxable\nperson may be attached, including a bank account. The attachment is provisional and the statute has\ncontemplated an attachment during the pendency of the proceedings under the stipulated statutory\nprovisions noticed earlier . An attachment which is contemplated in Section 83 is, in other words, at a\nstage which is anterior to the finalization of an assessment or the raising of a demand. Conscious as the\nlegislature was of the draconian nature of the power and the serious consequen ces which emanate from\nthe attachment of any property including a bank account of the taxable person, it conditioned the exercise\nof the PART D power by employing specific statutory language which conditions the exercise of the\npower . The language of the statute indicates first, the necessity of the formation of opinion by the\nCommissioner; second, the formation of opinion before ordering a provisional attachment; third the\nexistence of opinion that it is necessa ry so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of the\ngovernment revenue ; fourth, the issuance of an order in writing for the attachment of any property of the\ntaxable person; and fifth, the observance by the Commissioner of the provisions contained in the rules in\nregard to the manner of attachment. Each of these components of the statute are integral to a valid\nexercise of power . In other words, when the exercise of the power is challenged, the validity of its\nexercise will depend on a strict and punctilious observance of the statuto ry preconditions by the\nCommissioner . While conditioning the exercise of the power on the formation of an opinion by the\nCommissioner that \"for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue, it is necessary\nso to do\", it is evident that the statute has not left the formation of opinion to an unguided subjective\ndiscretion of the Commissioner . The formation of the opinion must bear a proximate and live nexus to the\npurpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue.\n49. By utilizing the expression \"it is necessary so to do\" the legislature has evinced an intent that an\nattachment is authorized not merely because it is expedient to do so (or profitable or practicable for the\nrevenue to do so) but because it is necessary to do so in order to protect interest of the government\nrevenue. Necessity postulates that the interest of the revenue can be protected only by a provisional\nattachment without which the interest of the revenue would PART D stand defeated. Necessity in other\nwords postulates a more stringent requi rement than a mere expediency . A provisional attachment under\nsection 83 is contem plated during the pendency of certain proceedings, meaning thereby that a final\ndemand or liability  is yet to be crysta llized. An anticipatory attachment of this nature must strictly\nconform to the requirements, both substantive and procedural, embodied in the statute and the rules. The\nexercise of unguided discretion cannot be permissible because it will leave citizens and their legitimate\nbusiness activities to the peril of arbitrary power . Each of these ingredients must be strictly applied before\na provisional attachment on the property  of an assesses can be levied. The Commissioner must be alive to\nthe fact that such provisions are not intended to authorize Commissioners to make preemptive strikes on\nthe property of the assessee, merely because property is available for being attached. There must be a\nvalid formation of the opinion that a provisional attachment is necessary for the purpose of protecting the\ninterest of the government revenue.\n50. These expression s in regard to both the purpose and necessity of provisional attachment implicate the\ndoctrine of proportionality . Proportionality mandates the existence of a proximate or live link between the\nneed for the attachment and the purpose  which it is intended to secure. It also postulates the maintenance\nof a propo rtion between the nature and extent of the attachment and the purpo se which is sought to be\nserved by ordering it. Moreover , the words embodied in sub-section (1) of section 83, as interpreted\nabove, would leave no manner of doub t that while ordering a provisional attachment the Commissioner\nmust in the formatio n of the opinion act on the basis of tangible material on the PART D basis of which\nthe formation of opinion is based in regard to the existence of the statutory requirement. While dealing\nwith a similar provis ion contained in Section 4536 of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003 , one of us\n(Hon'ble Mr Justice MR Shah) speaking for a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in Vishwanath\nRealtor  v. State of Gujarat  37 observed:\n\"8.3 Section 45 of the VAT Act confers powers upon the Commissioner to pass the order of provisional\nattachment of any property belonging to the dealer during the pendency of any proceedings of assessmentor reassessment of turnover escaping assessment. However , the order of provisional attachment can be\npassed by the Commissioner when the Commissioner is of the opinion that for the purpose of protecting\nthe interest of the Government Revenue, it is necessary so to do. Therefore, before passing the order of\nprovisional attachment, there must be an opinion formed by the Commissioner that for the purpose of\nprotecting the interest of the Government Revenue during the pendency of any proceedings of assessment\nor reasses sment, it is necessary to attac h provisionally any property belonging to the dealer . However ,\nsuch satisfaction must be on some tangible material on objective facts with the Commissioner . In a given\ncase, on the basis of the past conduct of the dealer and on the basis of some reliable information that the\ndealer is likely to defeat the claim of the Revenue in case any order is passed against the dealer under the\nVAT Act and/or the dealer is likely to sale his properties and/or sale and/or dispose of the properties and\nin case after the conclusion of the asses sment/reassessment proceedings, if there is any tax liability , the\nRevenue may not be in a position to recover the amount thereafter , in such a case only, however , on\nformation of subjective satisfaction/opinion, the Commissioner may exercise the powers under section 45\nof the V AT Act.\" (emphasis supplied) Section 45 (1) provides as follows:\n51. W e adopt the test of the existence of \"tangible material\". In this context, reference may be made to the\ndecision of this Court in the Commissioner of Income-tax  v. Kelvinator of India Limited  38. Mr Justice\nSH Kapadia (as the learned Chief Justice then was) while considering the expression \"reason  to believe\"\nin section 147 of the Income-tax Act 1961 that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment inter\nalia by the omission or failure of the assess ee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for\nthe assessment of that year, held that the power to reopen an assessment must be conditioned on the\nexistence of \"tangible material\" and that \"reasons  must have a live link with the formation of the belief\".\nThis princ iple was followed subsequentl y in a two judge Bench decision in Income-tax Officer , Ward No.\n162 (2) v. Techspan India Private Limited  39. While advertin g to these decisions  we have noticed that\nSection 83 of the HPGST Act uses the expression \"opinion\" as distinguished from \"reasons  to believe\".\nHowever for the reasons  that we have indicated earlier we are clearly of the view that the formation of\nthe opinio n must be based on tangible material which indicates a live link to the necessity to order a\nprovisional attachment to protect the interest of the government revenue.\n53. Under  sub-rule (1) of rule 159, an attachment of property by the Commissioner under section 83 is\neffected by passing an order mentioning  the details of the property which is attached. The form in which\nthe order is to be made is prescribed in form GST DRC-22. This form is extracted below: P ART D.\n54. Under  sub-rule (5) of rule 159, the person whose property is attached is allowed seven days' time to\nfile an objection that the property attached \"was or is not liable to attachment\". Sub-Rule (5) stipulates\nthat the Commissio ner may \"after affording an opportunity of being heard to the person filing the\nobjection\" release the property by an order in form GSTDRC-23. Similarly , under sub-Rule PART D (6)\nupon being satisfied that the property was or is no longer liable to be attached, the Commissioner is\nempowered to release the property by issuing an order in Form GST DRC- 23 for the releasing of the\nproperty under attachment. The Form is extracted below :\n55. A significant aspect of Rule 159(5 ) is that upon the levy of a provisional attachment, the person\nwhose property is attached is empowered to file an objection within seven days on the ground that the\nproperty was or is not liable to attachment. In using the expression \"was or is no longer liable for\nattachment\", PART D the delegate of the legislature has comprehended two alternative situations. The\nfirst, evidenced by the use of the words \"was\" indicates that the property was on the date of the\nattachment in the past not liable to be attached. That is the reason  for the use of the past tense \"was\". The\nexpression \"is not liable to attachment indicates a situation  in praesenti . Even if the property , arguably ,\nwas validly attached in the past, the person whose property has been attached may demonstrate to the\nCommissioner that it is not liable to be attached in the present.\n56. The second significant aspect of sub-rule (5) is the mandatory requirement of furnishing an\nopportunity of being heard to the person whose property is attached. This is in consonance with the\nprinciples of natural justice and ensures that a fair procedure is observed. Sub-rule (5) provides for a\npost- provisional attachment right of:\n(i) Submitting an objection to the attachment;\n(ii) An opportunity of being heard.Sub-rule (5) contains clear language to the effect that a person whose property is attached is entitled to\ntwo procedural entitlements: first, the right to submit an objection on the ground that the property was not\nor is not liable to be attached; and secon d, an opportunity of being heard to the person filing an objection.\nThis is a clear indicator that in addition the filing of an objection, the person whose property is attached is\nentitled to an oppor tunity of being heard. It is not open to the Commissioner , as has been stated in the\npresent case, to hold the view that the only safeguard under sub-rule 5 is to submit an objection without\nan PART D opportunity of a personal hearing. Such a construction would be plainly contrary to sub-rule\n5 which contemplates both the submission of an objection to the attachment and an opportunity of being\nheard. The opportunity of being heard can be availed of as a matter of right by the person whose property\nis attached. Both the right to submit an objection and to be afforded an opportunity of being heard are\nvaluable safeguards. The consequence of a provisional attachment is serious. It displaces the person\nwhose property is attached from dealing with the property . Where a bank account is attached, it prevents\nthe person  from operating the account. A business entity whose bank account is attached is seriously\nprejudiced by the inability to utilize the proceeds of the account for the purpose of business. The dual\nprocedural safeguards inserted in sub-rule 5 of rule 159 demand strict compliance.\nThe Commissioner who hears the objec tions must pass a reasoned  order either accepti ng or rejecting the\nobjections. To allow the Commissioner to get by without passing a reasoned  order will make his decision\nsubjective and defeat the purpose of subjecting it to judicial scrutiny . The Commissioner must deal with\nthe objections and pass a reasoned  order indicating whether , and if not, why the objections are not being\naccepted. Sub-rule 6 of rule 159 allow s for the release of a property which either was or is no longer\nliable for attachment. The form in which such an order has to be passed, namely form GST DRC-23,\nstates that \"now there is no such proceeding pending against the defaulting person which warrants\nattachment\" of the account or as the case may be, the property . Sub-rules 5 and 6 do not expressly\ncontemplate a situation in which the person PART D whose property is attached can object on the ground\nthat the attachment is in excess of the amount likely to be due for which proceed ings have been launched\nunder the Act. Nor does it provide for a specific opportunity to the taxable perso n to offer any alternative\nform of security in lieu of the attachment. Such an opportunity must be read in to the provision to allow\nfor a fair working in practice. Whether any alternative security that is furnished by the taxable person\nshould be accepted and if so, its sufficiency , is a matter for the Commissioner to determine. Undoubtedly ,\nthe taxabl e person may not have a right to demand that only a particular form of security must be\naccepted. The Commissioner has to decide whether the form of security offered would secure the interest\nof the revenue. Whe re the taxable person sets up the plea that the extent of the attachment is excessive or\nwhere the taxable person offers an alternative form of security , these are also matters which ought to be\ndetermined by the Commissioner in the exercise of powers under rule 159(5). The scope of objection can\nalso exten d to the nature of the property which is being provisionally attached. Now, it is in this backdrop\nthat we proceed to a determination of whether the petition under article 226 was maintainable and if it\nwas, whether Commissioner exercised the powers under section 83 read with rule 159 in accordance with\nlaw.\n59. The sole ground  which has weighed with the High Court in holding that the writ proceedings were\nnot maintainable is that \"the writ petitioner has not only (an) efficacious remedy , rather alternative\nremedy under the GST Act\". In addition, the High Court has observed that the writ petition filed by GM\nPower tech against whom similar allegations have been leveled had been dismissed by relegating it to the\npursuit of an altern ative remedy . The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\nsubmitted that GM Powertech had been relegated to the pursuit of an alternative remedy since an order of\nassessment had been passed against it. However , insofar as the appellant is concerned, the writ\nproceedings were instituted to challenge the levy of a provisional attachment under section 83 and there\nis no alternative remedy provided under the Act for challenging an order under section 83.'\n11. Similar issue fell for consideration before a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the case of\nAnjani Impex  (supra ). Paragraphs 15 to 17 of the said judgment, read as follows:\n'15. A Coordinate Bench of this Court, to which one of us J.B. Pardiwala, J. was a party , had the occasion\nto discuss section 83 of the Act in the case of Valerius Industries vs. Union of India, Special Civil\nApplication No. 13132 of 2019, decide d on 28th August, 2019, wherein this Court drew the following\nconclusion:\n\"[1] The order of provisional attachment before the assessment order is made, may be justified if the\nassessing authority or any other authority empowered in law is of the opinion that it is necessary toprotect the interest of revenue. Howeve r, the subjective satisfaction should be based on some credible\nmaterials or information and also should be supported by supervening factor . It is not any and every\nmaterial, howsoever vague and indefinite or distant remote or far-fetching, which would warrant the\nformation of the belief.\n[2] The power conferred upon the authority under section 83 of the Act for provisional attachment could\nbe termed  as a very drastic and far reaching power . Such power should be used sparingly and only on\nsubstantive weighty grounds and reasons .\n[3] The power of provisional attachmen t under section 83 of the Act should be exercised by the authority\nonly if there is a reasonable  apprehension that the assessee may default the ultimate collection of the\ndemand that is likely to be raised on completion of the assessment. It should, therefore, be exercised with\nextreme care and caution.\n[4] The power under section 83 of the Act for provisional attachment should be exercised only if there is\nsufficient material on record  to justify the satisfaction that the asses see is about to dispose of wholly or\nany part of his/her property with a view  to thwarting the ultimate collection C/SCA/9822/2020 ORDER\nof demand and in order to achieve the said objective, the attachment should be of the properties and to\nthat extent, it is required to achieve this objective.\n[5] The power unde r section 83 of the Act should neither be used as a tool to harass the assessee nor\nshould it be used in a manner which may have an irreversible detrimental effect on the business of the\nassessee.\n[6] The attachment of bank account and trading assets should be resorted to only as a last resort or\nmeasure. The provisional attachment under section 83 of the Act should not be equated with the\nattachment in the course of the recovery proceedings.\n[7] The authority before exercising power under section 83 of the Act for provisional attachment should\ntake into considerat ion two things: (i) whether it is a revenue neutral situation (ii) the statement of\n\"output liability or input credit\". Having regard to the amount paid by reversing the input tax credit if the\ninterest of the revenue is sufficiently secured, then the authority may not be justified in invoking its\npower under section 83 of the Act for the purpose of provisional attachment.\"\n16. W e are of the view that none of the above referred conditions are fulfilled in the present case.\n17. In the result, this writ application stands partly allowed. The relief with regard to the order in Form\nGST DRC -01A is not granted, whereas the order of provisional attachment of immovable property under\nsection 83 of the Act is quashed and set aside'.\n12. A perusal of the impugned orders of provisional attachment shows that the fourth respondent herein stated\nin the said orders that, as per the information available with the Department and in order to protect the interest\nof the Government revenue, in exercise  of the powers conferred under section 83 of the Act, the account is\nprovisionally attached.\n13. In this context, it may be appropriate to refer to the provisions of rule 159 of the Sales Tax Rules.\nAccording to sub-rule (5) of rule 159 of the Rules, the assessee may, within seven days of the attachment\nunder sub-rule (1), file an objection to the effect that the property attached was or is not liable to attachment\nbefore the Commissioner and the Com missioner may, after affording an opportunity of being heard to the\nperson filing the objection, release the said property by an order in FORM GST DRC-23.\n14. Admittedly , except saying that the orders of provisional attachment are passed in order to protect the\ninterest of the Government revenue, no other reasons  are assigned by the fourth respondent in the impugned\norders of provisional attachment. When sub-rule (5) of rule 159 of the Rules specifically provides for filing\nobjections against the orders of provisional attachment, the contention that the reasons  for ordering\nprovisional attachment were recorded  in the Note File and that there is no need to extract the same or state the\nsame in the provisional order of attachm ent, in the considered opinion of this Court, cannot stand for judicial\nscrutiny . The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the above referred judgment, also categorically ruled that the\nformation of opinion on the basis of tangible material which indicates the necessity to order provisional\nattachment to protect the interest of the Government revenue is mandatory .\n15. Unless reasons  are recorded  broadly , the assessee cannot be expected to file any objections under the\nprovisions of sub-rule (5) of rule 159 of the Rules. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the above referredSBjudgment, held that exercise of unguided discretion under section 83 of the Act would not be permissible as it\nwill leave citizens and their legitimate business activities to the peril of arbitrar y power . Having regard to the\nlanguage employed by the legislature in section 83 of the Act and rule 159(5) of the Rules and the judgments\nreferred to (supra ), this Court is of the opinion that the fourth respondent failed to adhere to the mandatory\nrequirement of formation of opinion. It is also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, by\npressing into service  the provisions of section 67 of the Act, the respondent authorities conducted inspection,\nsearch and seizure. It is also submitted by the learned counsel that, pursuant to the summons issued under\nsection 70 of the Act, the Director and the employees appeared before the competent authority and their\nstatements were also recorded  and the documents were also seized. It is further submitted that, in view of the\nsame, it cannot be said that the proceedings under section 67 of the Act are pending. In order to show that the\nrespondents have concluded proceedings under section 67 of the Act, a copy of the order of seizure  vide Form\nGST INS -02 under rule 139(2) of the Rules is filed as a material paper .\n16. On the other hand, it is submitted by the learned Government Pleader that the provisional orders of\nattachment were communicated to the petitioner and the proceedings under section 67 of the Act are still\nincomplete and are pending.\n17. In view of the above reasons , having regard to the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner\nand the judgments referred to above, this Court is of the opinion that the petitio ner has made out prima facie\ncase for grant of interim relief.\n18. For the aforesaid reasons , there shall be interim suspension of the provisional attachment orders, dated 1-\n4-2022 and 6-4-2022, till 15-7-2022.\n19. Post the matter for hearing on 5-7-2022.\n*In favour of petitioner ."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - Both these writ petitions are filed by the same writ petitioners. Writ petition\nNo.9213 of 2019 is filed challenging the proceedings in F.No.DGGI/VZU/INV/GST/13/2019, dated 8-3-2019\nissued by the 3rd respondent provisionally attaching the bank account of the 1st petitioner and some others\nunder section 83 of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short 'CGST Act, 2017') and the notice in\nF.No.DGGI/VZU/INV/GST/13/2019/2246-48, dated 9-7-2019 issued by the Deputy Director on the approval\nof the 3rd respondent informing the 5th respondent - Branch Manager , Laxmi Vilas Bank, Guntur that on the\nrequest of the petitioners and one Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy , the date of opening of the bank lockers\nhas been fixed as 24-7-2019, as illegal and contrary to the provisions of the CGST Act and its rules and\nviolative of articles 14, 19(1)( g), 21 and 300(A) of the Constitution of India  and also violative of principles of\nnatural justice and consequently to  set aside the aforesaid proceedings.\nWhereas, the writ petition No.21402 of 2020 is filed challen ging the proceedings in\nF.No.DGGSTII/VZU/INV/GST/13/2019, dated 6-3-2020 and the consequential letter in\nF.No.DGGI/VZU/INV/GST/13/2019/2044, dated 9-11-2020 issued by the Deputy Director on the approval of\nthe 3rd respondent informing the 6th respondent - Branch Manager , Lakshmi Vilas Bank that 5th respondent\nis authorized to open bank locker of the 1st petitioner and her son P. Bhanu Prakash in their presence on 17-\n11-2020, as illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017\nand its Rules, and violative of fundamental rights under articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21 and 300(A) of the\nConstitution of India  and consequently to  set aside the aforesaid proceedings.\n2. The case of the respondent department as can be seen from their counter is thus:(a) One Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy with the assistance of his business accomplices including the\n1st petition er who is the proprietor of Sri Hanuman Enterprises, passed fake Input Tax Credit (ITC)\ninvoices on large scale in the name of different fictitious/shell firms within the States of Andhra\nPradesh and Telang ana during the period July, 2017 to February , 2019 witho ut actual supply of\ngoods in violation of CGST Act, 2017  and Rules. The investigation initiated  by the Officers of\nDirector General of GST (Intelligence), Visakhapatnam Zonal Unit revealed the said fact and they\nconducted searches in some of the premises of those fictitious/shell firms operated by V.V Subba\nReddy and the 1st petitioner . The searches were conducted in the places like Guntur , Vijayawada,\nNarsaraopeta, Hyderabad etc., and they revealed that no business firms have operated from those\npremises and the CGST registrations were taken fraudulently in the names of different firms using\nwrong credentials/a ddresses with a view to passing of ITC by issuing fake tax invoices without\nactual supply of goods. Investigation further revealed that around 90 different firms are operated by\nV.V Subba Reddy for the purpose of claiming ITC by issue of fake tax invoices during the period\nand these firms operated in a network so as to conceal evasion. Some of the fictitious/shell firms,\nwhere searches were conducted, have admittedly purchased the fake tax invoices without actual\nreceipt of goods from the firms operated by V .V Subba Reddy . Investigation is still under progress.\n(b) The respondent officials have arrested Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy on 11-3-2019 for violation\nof section 132(1)( b) and section 132(1) (c) of CGST Act, 2017 and fraudulently passing on ITC by\nissuing fake tax invoices without actual supply of goods in the name of different fictitious firms.\nLearned Judge of Economic Offences Court, Visakhapatnam remanded Vennapusa Venkata Subba\nReddy to judicial custody on 12-3-2019 and later conditional bail was granted to him on 18-6-2019\nwith a direction to appear before the Investigating Of ficer once in a week.\n(c) As a part of investigation, the registered  business premises of M/s Sri Hanuman Enterprise of the\n1st petitioner located at Guntur was searched under Panchanama on 12-7-2019. The search\nproceedings reveale d that the address is an open vacant land without any premises and no business\nfirm including firm created in the name of M/s. Hanuman Enterprise (with 1st petitioner as\nproprietor) has ever operated from the premises. As a part of investigation, the officials have also\nsearched premises of M/s Sree Kaveri Enterprises on 12-7-2019 and noticed that the said firm never\noperated from the premises. The statement of Jaluri Sai Babu, the proprietor of the said enterprise\nwas recor ded on 13-7-2019 wherein it was stated that he has given his credentials for opening\nbusiness firm to the 1st petitioner and that all documents for creation of the firm including the\nopening of the bank account in Lakshmi Vilas Bank were handed over to one Sri Nalla Venkataiah\nat the request of 1st petitioner . He has further stated that the firm opened in the name of M/s. Sree\nKaveri Enterprise including the bank account in the firm name was created and operated by the 1st\npetitioner and he was not aware about the taking of the CGST Registration in the name of the firm\nand he requested the 1st petitioner to close the firm and the bank account but she has not informed\nabout the details of the business operations. Thus, from the statement of the Jaluri Sai Babu, it is\nclear that the 1st petitioner is one of the business accomplices of Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy\nin creation  of fictitious firms by collecti ng credentials from different individuals for the purpose of\nissue of fake tax invoices for fraudulent passing on ITC. In this background, the bank accounts of\nthe fictitious firms were provisionally attached in the interest of protecting the Government\nrevenue. As a part of it, the bank account numbers 408351939 and 408335789 and Locker No.8\nstanding in the name  of the 1st petitioner were also ordered for provisional attachment on 8-3-2019\nin the interest of Government revenu e and with a reasonable belief that some incriminating\ndocuments/records relating to the case under investigation and cash might be secreted in those\nlockers.\n(d) Subsequent to the release of Vennapu sa Venkata Subba Reddy on bail on 18-6-2019, the 3rd\nrespondent addressed a letter dated 2-7-2019 to the Branch Manager , Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Guntur\nand sent a copy to the 1st petitioner inter alia intimating that the authorization was given to Sri\nBhaskar Prasad/the 4th respondent in W.P.No.9213 of 2019 to open and search the bank locker\nNo.8 standing in the name of the 1st petitioner . However , on the request of the 1st petitioner to\npostpone the date of opening of the locker , the same was postponed to 24-7-2019. In the meanwhile\nthe petitioners filed the present writ petitions.\n(e) The contention of the respondents is that the bank accounts were attached and lockers were sought\nto be opened as a part of the investigation and by following the CGST Act and Rules and therefore,the petitioners cannot claim any violation of their rights.\n3. Heard Sri V.V. Lakshmi Narayana, learned counsel for petitioners Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar Senior Standing\nCounsel for Central Excise, Customs and Service T ax representing respondent Nos.1 to 4 and 6.\n4. The main contentio n of the learned counsel for petitioners is that while attach ing the bank account of the\npetitioners  vide impugned proceedin gs F.No.DGGI/VZU/INV/GST/13/2019 dated 8-3-2019, no show cause\nnotice was served on the petitioners to offer their explanation. So also the bank locker number -8 of the\npetitioners was freezed and no opportunity was given to the petitioners to submit their explanation. Due to\nattachment of the accounts and freezing of locker , the petitioners are suffering a lot. The petitioners submitted\nrepresentation dated 9-7-2019 through e-mail but the 3rd respondent did not consider the same. Hence,\nprinciples of natural justice were infringed. Learned counsel vehemently argued that the petitioners have\nnothing to do with Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy and they are not shell companies or the accomplice of\nthe said V ennapusa V enkata Subba Reddy . He thus, prayed to allow the writ petitions.\n(a) Per contra , Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar , representing respondents vehemently opposed the writ petitions\narguing that the accused Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy opened around 90 shell companies and\ncreated fake invoices without actual supply of goods and thus cheated Government. He would\nsubmit that the investigation is in the prime stage and department reasonably believes that opening\nof the lockers of the petitioners and other shell companies will provide necess ary documents and\nmoney etc., connected to the case. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petitions.\n5. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petitions to allow .\n6. We gave our anxiou s consideration to the above respective submissions. A perusal of the remand report, a\ncopy of which is filed along with the material papers by the petitioners would show that the Senior\nIntelligence Officer levelled allegations against Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy that he was indulged in\nissue of fake GST invoices in the name of more than 70 fictitious/non-opera ting firms created by him at\ndifferent locations in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana without actual supply of goods to facilitate\navailment of irregular input tax credit and thereby defrauded the Government's tax revenue. It is further\nalleged that search operations were conducted in the registered office premise s of different enterprises and\nalso the premises of the Accountant of Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy and incriminating documents were\nrecovered. Scrutiny of the documents revealed that Vennapusa Venkata Subb a Reddy created 70 different\nfictitious/shell firms  in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for taking GST registrations. The modus operandi of\nthe said Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy was that he opened the fictitious firms only on paper to issue fake\nGST invoi ces showing supply of iron and steel goods, chemicals, battery scrap, led etc. This fictitious firms\ngenerally operated in three levels. The firms operating at first level in the chain, will issue fake invoices\nwithout actual supply of goods in the name of firms operating at second level without any corresponding\npurchases and thus first level firms will neither pay GST nor file monthly GSTR -3B returns. The second level\ncompanies issue GST invoices in the name of firms operating at third level basing on the fake GST invoices\nissued by the 1st level firms and these second level firms show payment of GST utilizing irregular input tax\ncredit taken basing on the invoice issued by the first level firms and accordingly , file monthly GSTR-3B\nreturns. In turn, the firms operating at third level issue fake GST invoices without actual supply of goods to\ndifferent business firms/companies in consideration for commission and the firms operating at third level\nshow payment of GST utilizing the irregularly generated ITC basing on the invoices issued by the second\nlevel firms and accordingly file monthly  returns. Thus, there will be no money , bank transactions at the first\nand second levels. However , bank accounts are opened with Lakshmi Vilas Bank in the name of firms\noperating at third level showing receipt of sale consideration through banking channels from different\nbusiness firms/companies in whose name fake GST invoices are issued for passing on ITC. In this process,\nVennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy has issued fake GST invoices with a total turnover of Rs. 397,28,1 1,944/-\nwithout supply of goods to different business firms/companies by passing on a total fraudulent input tax credit\nof Rs. 61,30,33,274 /- in respect of 21 firms, out of more than 70 firms created by him and thus caused huge\nloss to the Government exchequer . The investigation is stated to be pending.\n(a) In furtherance of investigation, the Senior Intelligence Officer has attached the bank accounts and\nlockers of some of the companies on the apprehension that they are operating as shell companies\nfor Venna pusa Venkata Subba Reddy .

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner , learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax appearing for\nrespondent Nos.1 and 2 and Sri N. Harin ath, learned Assistant Solicitor General appearing for respondent No.\n3.\n3. With their consent, this W rit Petition is disposed of at the stage of admission.\n4. It may not be necessary for us to go into the facts in detail for the reason that the order impugned is\nchallenged mainly on the ground that no opportunity of personal hearing was given to the petitioner , as\ncontemplated under section 75(4) of the I.G.S.T ./A.P .G.S.T . Act, 2017.SB5. Learned counsel submits that there is a variation in the amount shown in the show cause notice, dated 2-6-\n2020, and the order passed by the Assessing Officer. Having regard to the above, he would contend that the\nmatter be remanded back to the party concerned for fresh decision after giving opportunity of hearing.\n6. The same  is opposed by the learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax contending that a reading of\nsection 75(4) of A.P.G.S.T . Act contemplates that an opportunity of hearing would be given only when a\nrequest is made.\n7. In order to appreci ate the rival arguments advanced namely as to whether an opportunity of hearing is\nrequired to be given or not, it would be appropriate to refer to section 75(4) of the A.P.G.S.T . Act, which reads\nas under :-\n\"75(4) An opportunity of hearing shall be granted where a request is received in writing from the person\nchargeable with tax or penalty , or where any adverse decision is contemplated against such person.\"\n8. From a reading of the above provision, it is very much evident that an opportun ity of hearing shall be given\nwhen a request is made in writing by the person who is charged with tax or penalty or where any adverse\ndecision is contemplated.\n9. In the instant case, a notice for personal hearing, dated 13-10-2020, was issued to the petitioner . But on that\nday, the Assistant Commissioner directed the petitioner herein to produce documents for verification but\nhowever , did not give any date for hearing. Without hearing the petitioner , an adverse order came to be\npassed, which is impugned in this case. Therefore, it can be said that there is violation of Section 75(4) of the\nA.P.G.S.T . Act. It may not be necessary for us to go into the other aspects since the impugned order is liable to\nbe set aside on this ground alone.\n10. Acco rdingly , this Writ Petition is allowe d setting aside the order passed by respondent No. 1 in Form GST\nDRC-07  vide Reference No. 1/IGST , dated 14-12-202 0, relating to the tax periods from 04/2018 to 03/2019\nunder the IGST Act, 2017, and the matte r is remanded back to respondent No. 1 for consideration of the same\nafter giving notice of personal hearing to the petitioner .

He submits that the said order is appealable for which the period of limitation is three months under section\n107 (1) of APGST Act, 2017 (in short 'the Act'). He further submits that so far as the amount under Sl.No.1\n(supra ) is concerned, the petitioner intends to file the appeal for which the period of limitation has yet not\nexpired.\n6. He furthe r submits that so far as the amount under Sl.No.2 (supra ) is concerned, the petitioner is ready to\nmake the payment thereof, but in instal ments, for which there is provision under section 80 of the Act. The\npetitioner is ready to make written application under section 80 of the Act before the concerned authority\nelectronically , but the system is not accepting the same, for Sl.No.2 (supra ) only. He submits that\nelectronically the petitioner will have to apply for the total amount includin g both the Sl. Nos.(1) & (2)\n(supra ), where as the petitioner intends to challenge the Order to the extent of Sl.No.1 (supra ). The\npetitioner's application if filed manually would not be accepted by the Authority .\n7. His further submission is that the impugned notice dated 1-1-2024 was issued within period of three months\nwhereas under section 78 of the Act the recovery proceedings can be initiated only when the amount is not\npaid withi n a period of three months from the date of service of the order . He submits the since the period of\nlimitation has not expired, the impugned notice could not be issued keeping deadline of 7 days for\ncompliance.\n8. Sri Shreyas Reddy submits that the petitioner has a remedy of appeal against the order , dated 1-1 1-2023 and\nhe should file statut ory appeal making due compliance of the statutory provisions for pre-deposit. However ,\nhe admits that the period of limitation has not yet expired, to file the appeal. He further submits that the\npetitioner has not filed any proof to show that the petitioner has approached the authority as per law under\nRule 158 of the CG & ST Rules 2017, by applying electronically , asking for fixing of instalments in respect ofAJAYSl.No.2 ( supra ) of the table or to show that any such grievance with respect to the system not accepting, only\nfor Sl.No.2, was raised before the Authority .\n9. Learned GP however does not dispute the legal position and also submits that the amount though\nmentioned under Sl. Nos.(1) & (2) cannot be bifurcated for applying under section 80 or under section 107 of\nthe Act, electronically , which is the prescribed procedure.\n10. We have considered the aforesaid submissions of the learned counsels for the parties.\n11. We are of the considered view that in view of Section 78 of the Act the petitioner has three months time,\nwhich has yet not expired, for making payment under the impugned order , may be in Sl.No.1 or/and Sl.No.2.\nConsequently , the impugned notice could not be issued or even if it has been issued, it cannot be implemented\nwithin the statutory period to make the payment.\n12. In view of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner , that the petitioner wants to\nfile appeal with respect to the liability/the amount under Sl.No.1, let the petitioner file appeal within the\nstatutory period after complying with the legal provisions to that extent.\n13. It is clarified that so far as the amoun t under Sl.No.1 is concerned, if the appeal is not filed within the\nstatutory period of three months, the respondents would be at liberty to proceeding further pursuant to the\nsame impugned notice with respect to the amount under Sl.No.1.\n14. So far as the amount under Sl.No.2 is concerned, since the petitioner is ready to make the payment of the\namount thereunder , in instalments and Section 80 of the Act provides for the concerned authority to fix\ninstalments for payment, to that exten t, the petitioner shall approach the authority by filing appropriate\napplication, manuall y, as it is submitted that the same is not being accepted electronically , under section 80 of\nthe Act, in the prescribed format, within a period of one week from the date of receipt of copy of this Order .\nThe autho rity shall thereafter consider the petitioner's request for fixing the instalments for payment as per\nlaw.\n15. It is further clarified  that if the petitioner does not approach the authority for Sl.No.2, as aforesaid, it shall\nbe open for the authority to proceed with respect to Sl. No.(2) as well as per law, pursuant to the impugned\nOrder/notice.\n16. We also observe that if the petitioner's grievance with respect to the system not accepting electronically\nthe applica tion for fixing instalments under section 80 or for filing appeal under section 107 with respect to\nthe part of the liability amount of tax/p enalty or interest, as the case may be, is correct and the system is\naccepting only such request electronically for the entire amount or entire order to avoid inconvenience to the\nother dealers, such grievance may be attended and appropriately resolved for future.\n17.

No. 2498 of 2018 is taken as a lead petition in\ndeciding the issue involved.\n2. The present Writ Petitions came to be filed to declare the Order in Appeal No. VIZ-GST -000-APP-021-21-\n22, dated 30-7-2021, passed by Respondent No. 1 herein rejecting the appeal filed by the Petitioner without\nconsidering the endorsement certificates filed by the Petitioner in the Appeal as illegal, improper and incorrect\nand violative of articles 14 and 19(1)( g) of the Constitution of India and conse quently to direct Respondent\nNo. 2 to grant refund to the Petitioner .\n3. The facts are as under:\ni. The Petitio ner is a Company registered under Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ['C.G.S.T .\nAct'] read with Andhra Pradesh Goods  and Services Tax Act, 2017 ['A.P .G.S.T . Act'] within the\nState of Andhra Pradesh.\nii. The Petitioner is primarily engaged in business of providing Express Courier Services to Units\nsituated in Special Economic Zone ['SEZ']. The period in dispute is between April, 2018 to July,\n2018 and August, 2018 to March, 2019.  The Petitioner made supplies to SEZ Unit, which are to be\ntreated as zero rated supplies and, as such, the Petitioner is entitled for refund of input taxes paid,\nwhile making zero rated supply , in view of Section 16 of Integrated Goods and Service Tax, 2017,\n['I.G.S.T . Act'].\niii. An application for refund came to be made under section 54 of C.G.S.T Act read with rule 89 of\nCentral Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017 ['C.G.S.T . Rules']. The said application has to be made\nwithin a period of two years from the relevant time, but, due to Covid Pandemic , the time limit was\nextended through Notifications from time-to-time.\niv. It is the case of the Petitioner that it has filed the refund claim in Form GST RFD-01 on 28-8-2020\n[Form GST RFD-01 on 30-8-2020 in W.P. No. 2478 of 2022] in terms of Section 54 of the C.G.S.T .\nAct read with Notification No. 35/2020 (Central Tax), dated 3-4-2020, as amen ded by Notification\nNo. 55/20 20 (Central Tax), dated 27-6-2020, for supplies made to its recipients, which are in SEZ.\nAn acknowledgment evidencing filing of refund claim was received by the Petitioner .\nv. It is said that, in order to file a refund claim, the Petitioner approached/corresponded with its\nrecipient  viz., the SEZ Units, to obtain endorsement certificates from the specified officer of their\nrespective zone in relation to receipt of services by these SEZ Units for their authorised operation.\nThe details of corre spondence are referred to in the affidavit which is not in dispute. It is further\naverred in the affidavit that, the SEZ Units were unable to obtain endorsement certificate from the\nspecified officer of SEZ due to restrictions imposed in the wake of Covid pandemic. Since, the\nrefund claims are to be filed on or before 31-8-2020, the Petitioner filed the refund claim along with\nnecessary supporting documents as outlined in C.G.S.T . Rules, except the endorsement certificate.\nvi. While things stood thus, the Petitioner received show cause notice in Form GST  RFD-08, dated 15-\n9-2020, [dated 14-9-2020 in W.P. No. 2478 of 2022] issued by Respondent No. 2, wherein the\nclaim of the Petitioner was denied on the ground that the endorsement certificates were not\nsubmitted by the Petitioner , and that the Petitioner was directed to show cause as to why the refund\nclaim should not be rejected for non-furnishing of the certificate within 15 days from the date of\nreceipt of notice. The Petitioner addres sed a letter , dated 28-9-2020, requesti ng 30 days time to\nfurnish a reply to the show cause notice. Thereafter , the Petitioner filed a reply to the show-cause\nnotice on 30-9-2020, explaining as to why the endorsement certificates could not be enclosed along\nwith the refund/claim, while other docu ments evidence zero rated supplies to SEZ Units. It is said\nthat, without considering the representa tion/reply made by the Petitioner , the Authorities rejected\nthe claim of Rs. 3,45,02,753/- [Rs.86,27,371/- in W.P. No. 2478 of 2022] on the ground of non-\nsubmission of endorsement certificate. Challenging the same, the Petitioner filed an Appeal No.\n3/2021, dated 5-1-2021, [Appeal No. 04/2021, dated 29-1-2021] before Respondent No. 1 in terms\nof Section 107 of the C.G.S.T . Act. In the said Appeals, the Petitioner explained the difficulty faced\nin obtainin g the endorsement certificate  and requested Respondent No. 1 to set-aside the refund\nrejection order .vii. Pending Appeals, the Petitioner requested the Development Commissioner of SEZ to help in\nobtaining endorsement certificates. Finally , the Petitioner was able to obtain endorsement\ncertificate, dated 11-1-2021, from the specified officer of Ramky Pharmacity India Limited, for a\nsubstantial portion of the services provi ded to SEZ Units for authorized operations. On receipt of\nthe said certificate, the Petitioner submitted the same to Respondent No. 1 by way of additional\nmaterial on 10-2-2021. The Petitioner attended the hearing on 13-7-2021 through its consultants,\nwherein, the grounds mentioned earlier , were reiterated. Without taking into consideration the\nsubmissions made, the Appeals came to be rejected only on the ground that the Petitioner has not\nsubmitted endorsement certificate within  the time specified and also along with refund claim. These\nOrders are sought to be challenged in this W rit Petitions.\n4. Counters came to be filed, in both the Writ Petitions, disputing the averments made in the affidavits filed in\nsupport of the Writ Petitions. A perusal of the averments in the counter show that the Petitioner herein has not\ncomplied with the statutory requirement, namely , filing of necessary documents within the time prescribed.\nInsofar as the docum ents relating to (1) April, 2018 to July, 2018 and (2) Augu st, 2018 to March, 2019, it is\npleaded that the Petitioner could have obtained the endorsement certificate much prior and taking the plea of\nCovid pandemic now, is an afterthought  and cannot be accepted. Referring to Rule 89 of C.G.S.T . Rules, it is\nsaid that, in the absence of endorsement certificate, it cannot be established that the impugned supplies are\nconsumed for specified purpose, in which case, refunds cannot be considered. It is averred that, a substantial\nconcession of refund cannot be granted on mere assumption and presumption, as the same cannot take the\nplace of proof.\n5. The short  question that arises for consideration is, whether the request of the Petitioner seeking a direction\nto the Appellate Authority to accept the endorsement certificate filed pending appeal can be accepted?\n6. (i) Sri. Karan Talwar , learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner , mainly submits that, when the statue\nprovides for making an application with a delay and since the endorsement certificate could not have been\nobtained from SEZ Units through specified officer due to Covid pandemic, the Authorities should have\nconsidered the request of the Petitioner , more so, when the Petitioner has been continuously corresponding\nwith the Responden ts expressing the difficulty in obtaining certificate. He further submits that, the finding of\nthe Appellate Authority that the Petitioner has not shown due diligence, may not be correct as e-mail\ncorrespondence exchanged between the parties establish otherwise. He furthe r submits that, the expression\n\"sufficient cause\" should be given a liberal interpretation to ensure that substantial justice is done so long as\nnegligence, inaction or lack of bona fides  cann ot be imputed  to the party concerned. He relied on the\nJudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Madanlal  v. Shyamlal  [2002] 1 SCC 535 in support of his plea.\n(ii) Sri. Karan Talwa r, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner , further submits that the Order\nimpugned in the Writ Petitions is in violation of principles of natural justice and violative of Article 14 of\nthe Constitution of India. According to him, the endorsement certificate could not be filed along with the\nrefund application, as the Petitioner could not secure the same by then and after causing due diligence, he\ncould secure the certificate pending appeal and, as such, filed those certificate in appeal. Therefore, the\nreason given for not filing the endorsement certificate along with the refund application within the time\nprescribed cannot be brushed aside, more so, when the statue provides that the Petitioner is entitled for\nrefund under section 24, and rule 1 12 prescribe filing of application even in appeal.\n(iii) In view of the above and having regard to the finding given by the Appellate Authority that\naccepting document at a belated stage is the discretion of the authority , submits that the Order under\nchallenge requires to be set-aside and consequently the matter be remande d back to the Appellate\nAuthority for fresh consideration by taking into consideration the endorsem ent certificate of Ramky\nPharmacity India Limited.\n7. Per contra , Sri. Suresh Kumar  Routhu, learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for Respondent Nos. 1\nto 3, opposed the same contending that when the Statue prescribed a thing to be done in a particular manner ,\nthe same has to be done in that manner  alone. In other words, his argument appears to be that, since Section\npostulates filing of endorsement certificate along with refund application, seeking a direction from this Court\nfor accept ing the endorsement certificate pending appeal, may not be correct. He further submits that, the\nPetitioner ought to have secured the endorsement certificate while filing the refund application and when the\nLimitation Act is not applicable to the case on hand, accepting the documents at a belated stage, in the\nabsence of any reasonable explanation, cannot be permitted. In view of the above, he would submit that the\nOrder under challenge warrants no interference and the W rit Petitions are liable to be dismissed.8. The fact that, the Petitioner has not filed the endorsement certificate along with the refund application is not\nin dispute. It is also not in dispute that, against the Order of refusing to grant refund, the Petitioner has\npreferred an appeal before the Respond ent No. 1. It is also not in dispute that the Petitioner has not filed\nendorsement certificate issued by the specified officer of the SEZ Unit along with the appeal also. Pending\nappeal, the Petitioner herein is said to have filed an application requesting the Appellate Authority to accept\nthe endorsement certificate issued by the specified of ficer in respect of its recipient SEZ Units.\n9. Coming to due diligence, it is to be noted that the Petitioner herein placed on record the correspondence,\nevidencing the efforts made to obtain endorsement certificates. Annexure-P6 filed along with the Writ Petition\nshow that right from 12-6-2020 till 8-1-2021 the Petitioner has been in continuous touch with its recipients\nSEZ Units  viz., Pfizer, Hobel Bellows, Astrotech Steels, MSR Garments and Ramky Pharmacity India\nLimited, but, ultima tely the Petitioner could secure endorsement certificates from Ramky Pharmacity India\nLimited. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Petitioner kept quiet without pursuing its remedies.\n10. Insofar as the plea of the Respondents that the Petitioner ought to have obtained endorsement certificate\nmuch prior to arrival of Covid in India,  it is to be noted here that the Petitione r herein has two years time to\nclaim refund and the Petitioner could not have anticipated that the pandemic will sweep the entire country\nduring that period. Therefore, non obtaining endorsement certificate prior to Covid pandemic cannot be a\nground to reject the claim. As stated earlier , the Petitioner could not have anticip ated the situation and when it\nthought of making an application within the time prescribed, the entire country was engulfed with pandemic.\nTherefore, as contended by the Petitioner , its efforts to obtain endorsement certificate within the time\nprescribed, proved futile, cannot be brushed aside.\n11. Coming to acceptance of additional evidence pending appeal, it would be just and proper to extract rule\n112 of the C.G.S.T . Rules, which reads as under:\n\"112. Production of Additional Evidence befor e the Appellate Authority or the Appellate T ribunal  -\n(1) The appellant shall not be allowe d to produce before the Appellate Authority or the Appellate\nTribunal any eviden ce, whether oral or documentary , other than the evidence produced by him during the\ncourse of the proce edings before the adjudicating authority or, as the case may be, the Appellate\nAuthority except in the following circumstances, namely:-\n(a) where the adjudica ting authority or, as the case may be, the Appellate Authori ty has refused to admit\nevidence which ought to have been admitted; or\n(b) where the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from producing the evidence which he was\ncalled upon to produce by the adjudicating authority or , as the case may be, the Appellate Authority; or\n(c) where the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from producing before the adjudicating\nauthority or, as the case may be, the Appellate Authority any evidence which is relevant to any ground of\nappeal; or\n (d)** ** **\n (2) & (3) ** ** **\n (a) to ( c)** ** **\n (4)** ** **\"\n12. A plain reading of the above, inter alia  makes it clear that the Appellate Authority has got all the power to\naccept additional evidence adduced by the appellant, when he is prevented by \"sufficient cause\" from\nproducing the material before the assessing officer. The issue came up for consideration before the High Court\nof the State of Gujarat in Avichal Press (P.) Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT 2012 SCC Online Guj. 6179. Dealing with the\nsame, the High Court observed as under:\n\"15. Rule 46A permitting additional evidence at the appellate stage before the Commissioner is\nessentially a rule of procedure. The grant of permission to produce the addition al evidence thereunder is\non the conditions mentioned therein. The rule should receive a liberal interpre tation with an object thatthe assessee is not deprived of opportunity to produce evidence in support of his case which he wanted to\nproduce at the initial stage, but was prevented for good reason.\n16. In the facts of the present case, the approach of CIT(A) as well as of the Tribunal with regard to\napplying rule 46A was wooden. As noted above, the factum of confirmations was already there before\nthe Assessing Officer, but the same was not accepted on the ground that the letters were signed by the\nManaging Director of the Assessee-Company . Therefore, when in the proceedings of appeal, the\nconfirmation letters of the parties were produced with explanation for not produ cing the same, there was\nno reason for the assessing of ficer to reject the same.\n17. Fresh confirmation letters were only in continuation of previous ones already produced. They were\nproduced only in compliance of requirement on which the Assessing Officer based his rejection. They\nwere, as such, not new evidence. The refusal to permit them was mechanical and suffered from non\napplication of mind. The assessee's case for permission to produce such additional evidence clearly fell\nunder clause (b) of sub rule (1) of 46A that he was prevented by sufficient cause from producing the\nconfirmation letters,  which he was called upon to produce by the Assessing Officer. Those confirmation\nletters were in support of the ground of assessee's appeal, therefore, it was covered under sub-clause (c)\nalso.\"\n13. Further , Rule 112(4) of C.G.S.T . Rules  postulate that, nothing contained in the said Rule shall affect the\npower of the Appe llate Authority or the Appellate Tribunal to direct production of any document, or\nexamination of any witness, to enable it to dispose of the appeal. In fact, section 107(1 1) of C.G.S.T . Act\ncontemplate that, before disposing of any appeal, the Appellate Authority may make any further inquiry as he\nthinks fit. The said provision is akin to section 250 of the Income-tax Act, which is similar to section 107 of\nC.G.S.T . Act, which deals with the procedure in appeal before the Appellate Authority . Ergo, having regard to\nthe judgments, referred to above and the provisions of law, it is very much clear that the Appellate Authority\nhas got power in a given set of circumsta nces, to accept the request of taking additional evidence on record. In\nfact, the Appellate Authority in paragra ph No. 11 of the Order categorically states that, \"as a rule, additional\nevidence is not permitted to be produced, for the first time, in appeal proceedings. However , additional\nevidence at the appellate stage cane be entertained, at the discretion of the appellate authority , in cases where\nit can be proved that the party did not get the opportunity to file the documents at the lower stage or the\noriginal authority refused to admit the evidence or the appellant establishes that it had exercised due diligence,\nbut was still unable to produce such evidence during the original proceedings. Therefore, the circumstances on\nwhich the discretion can be exercised for entertaining additional evidence at the belated stage squarely fits in\nthe instant case, more so in view of the findings of the Appellate Authority . Therefore, on this score as well\nthe Appellate Authority ought to have accepted the request of the Petitioner .\n14. Com ing to the last issue, namely , no opportunity was given to the Petitioner to explain the rejection of its\nclaim, it would be appropriate to refer to few sentences in paragraph No. 12 of the Order , which is as under:\n\"A cursory  scrutiny of the said certificates, it is observed that the said certificates were issued in respect\nof certain supplies received by M/s. Pfizer Healthcare India Pvt. Ltd, from the appellant during the period\nfrom October , 2017 to the second week of July, 2018. Thus, it is observed that the supplies relating to the\nclaim of Rs. 86,27,371/- filed for the period from August 2018 to March, 2019 are not covered in the said\ncertificates. Further , the supplies covered from October , 2017 to March, 2018 in the said certificates are\nnot releva nt for both the impugned refund claims, as the other claim was filed for the supplies made\nduring the period from April, 2018 to July, 2018. That being so, the certificates  related to supplies made\nto other supplies, such as Pokarna Engineered Stone etc., could not be produced by the appellant even\nnow. Thus , the certificates are found to be deficient in that they do not cover the entire period involved in\nthe claims nor did they cover all the supplies made during the material period to all the recipients.\"\n15. Insofar as these findings are concerned, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that, no opportunity\nwas given  to explain the reasons given  for rejecting the claim for the period April, 2018 to July, 2018 and\nAugust, 2018 to March, 2019. In fact, he would submit that, had an opportunity been given or a notice was\ngiven asking the Petitioner to explain, it would have explained to the Appellate Authority that the claim made\nwas relevant. The said ar gument of the learned counsel cannot be brushed aside.\n16. For the above reasons, the request of the Petitioner to accept the endorsement certificate, dated 11-1-2021,\nof the specified of ficer of Ramky Pharmacity India Limited, is allowed.SB17. Accordingly , the Writ Petitions are allowed setting aside the impugned Order , dated 30-7-2021, and the\nmatters are remanded back to the Appellate Authority to deal with the same afresh after accepting the\napplication filed by the Petitioner for additional evidence, in accordance with law . No Order as to Costs.\n18. As a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any , pending shall stand closed.\n*Partly in favour of assessee"}

Counsel for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nSri. C. Praveen Kumar , J. - Heard Sri. Singam Srinivasa Rao, learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the\nlearned Government Pleader for Commercial T axes.\n2. The present Writ Petition came to be filed seeking issuance of a writ of Mandamus declaring the\nAssessment Order , dated 3-3-2022, passed by the Second Respondent for the tax period from 26-9-2017 to\n31-3-2021 under G.S.T . Act, 2017, as illegal, arbitrary and in violation of principles of natural justice.\n3. The facts, which lead to filing of the present W rit Petition, are as under:-i. It is said that, the Petitioner is a registered taxpayer under Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax\nAct, 2017 ['A.P .S.G.S.T . Act'], with a trade name M/s. Sri Vasavi Wedding and Event Planners and\nan assessee on the roles of Second Respondent. It is said that the Petitioner is engaged in the\nbusiness of event management. It is said that the Effective Date of Registration ['EDR'] of the\nPetitioner is from 1-7-2017 and the said registration was cancelled from  1-8-2020 on the\napplication made by the Petitioner .\nii. It is said that, the Petitioner has filed GSTR 3B returns from July 2017 to January 2020 disclosing\nthe taxable turnover and taxes paid.\niii. In the month of August 2018, the husband of the Petitioner suffered a paralytic stroke and was\nunder medical treatment at Hyderabad in a Rehabilitation Centre and, as such the Petitioner could\nnot conduct event managements except small events up to January 2020 for livelihood. In the\nmonth of August 2020, the husband of the Petitioner again had an attack of brain paralysis and was\nbedridden as such no business was done. It is said that the Petitioner applied for cancellation of\nGST regis tration. It is further said that due to COVID-19 from March 2020 up to August 2021, no\npermission was granted to conduct functions having huge gathering except limited members.\niv. However , pursuant to the authorization  issued by the Joint Commissioner (ST), vide GSTIN-01,\ndated 5-10-2021, under section 71(1) of A.P. G.S.T . Act, the Second Respondent visited the\npremises of the Petitioner Firm on 5-11-2021. By that time, both the Petition er and her husband\nwere in Hyderabad for medical treatment of the husband of the Petitioner . It is said that the\nPetitioner gave a statement, dated 1-12-2021, to the Second Respondent explaining the above facts\nand also furnishing details of turnovers disclosed in GSTR 3B returns from July 2017 to March\n2020. While so, the Second Respondent  issued a Show Cause Notice, dated 6-1-2022, proposing to\nlevy IGST of Rs 18,00,000/-, CGST of Rs 26,55,000/- and SGST of Rs 26,55,000/-, for conducting\nmajor Events by the Petitioner and her husband.\nv. Pursuant to the Show Cause Notice, the husband of the Petitioner appeared before the Second\nRespondent on 10-2-2022 and obtained copies of the Facebook documents available with the\nSecond Respondent and requested 10 days time to submit reply . Though the husband of the\nPetitioner explained to Second Respondent that they have not conducted any events in respect of\ndocuments available  on Facebook and that the documents were uploaded only for advertisement\npurpose, and requested the Second Resp ondent to make available the informatio n, if any, conducted\nby them with other documentary evidence, however the Second Respondent did not provide any\nsuch information except the Facebook documents. It is said that, as the husband of the Petitioner\nagain fallen ill and was taken to Hyderabad for treatment; reply could not be submitted within the\nsaid 10 days.\nvi. It is said that, though the husband of the Petitioner brought to the notice of the Second and Third\nRespondents that due to COVID-19 1st and 2nd wave, no events were conducted from March 2020\nto July 2021 and that from July 2021 onwards events were permitted with limited persons; levying\nof tax from  March 2020 to March 2021  is not justified and requested to drop proposed levy of tax.\nBut, the Second Respondent without waiting for the explanation of the Petitioner , passed an\nAssessment Order , dated 3-3-2022, confirming the levy of I.G.S.T . of Rs.18,00,000/-, C.G.S.T . and\nS.G.S.T . of Rs 26,55,000/-, respectively . It is said that the action of the Second Respondent in\npassing the Assessm ent Order without receiving objections from the Petitioner as arbitrary , illegal\nand against the principles of natural justice.\nvii. It is also said that the Audit Officer without following the procedure contemplated under Sections\n71 & 74 of A.P. G.S.T . Act, and withou t giving an opportunity to the Petitioner to file objections,\npassed the Assessment Order . Thus, Second and Third Respondent have arbitrarily levied tax for\nthe period from 7-3-2020 to 31-3-2021.\n4. Sri. Singa m Sriniva sa Rao, learned Counsel for the Petitioner , mainly submits that, the Order passed by the\nSecond Respondent without providing an opportunity of hearing, is in violation of principles of natural\njustice. He further submits that, the Assessment Order passed by the Second Respondent is purely based on\nFacebook details and social media postings. In other words, his ar gument appears to be that, without any event\nbeing conducted by the Petitioner , the Authorities have burdened him with liability . Though, other grounds arereferred to by the Petitioner , but the learned Counsel for the Petitioner mainly pressed the two grounds,\nreferred to above.\n5. The same is opposed by the learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes, stating that many factual\naspects are involved, which are required to be adjudicated by the Tribunal and definitely not by this Court\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution of India. He further submits that, from  the personal window of the\nPetitioner , informati on has been gathered, which clearly indicate that the Petitioner has conducted many\nevents, the details of which were shown in the said platform.\n6. The point that arises for consideration is, whether the Petitioner is entitled for the relief claimed?\n7. Insofar as the first contention raised, that the Petitioner was not heard and no opportunity was given to him,\nmay not be correct , for the reason that, a perusal of the Order shows that the Petitioner was given the\nopportunity of raising objections to the notice issued. It also shows that, a notice  for personal hearing was also\nissued, pursuant to which, the Petitioner sought additional time, which was also granted, but the Petitioner\nnever responded thereafter . Therefore, it cannot be said that, there was any violation of principles of natural\njustice.\n8. Coming to the second contention i.e., the Assessment Order came to be passed by the Second Respondent\nbasing on Facebook details and social media postings. A perusal of the Order impugned, prima facie, show\nthat the authorities gathered information from the platform of the Petitioner , which is used for promotion of\nbusiness and basing on that G.S.T . was assessed.

In view of the above, prima facie it cannot be said that the Petitioner has not conducted any event during\nthe relevant period.\n10. Hence, we do not want to go into these factual aspects and, accordingly , the Writ Petition is dismissed\ngiving liberty to the Petitioner to approach the Appellate Authority and avail the remedy by putting forth the\ngrievances on the factual aspects. It is made clear that any observations made in this order are only for the\npurpose of passing this order and the same shall not influence the Appellate Authority while deciding the\nmatter , in case any Appeal is filed.

Sri K.S.Ravi Shankar , learned couns el appearing on behalf of the\npetitioners, would submit, relying on the specific averment in the petitioners' representation dated 21.06.2018,\nthat they had attemp ted to file their return on 27.12.2017. On the other hand Sri B.Narasimha Sarma, learned\nStanding Counsel, would draw our attention to the letter addressed by the petitioners on 19.02.2018 to submit\nthat, even on their own admission, the petitioners did not seek to file the retur n in FORM GST TRAN-1 by\n27.12.2017; and they had, in fact, admit ted having attempted to do so only on 28.12.2017. The fact, however ,\nremains that the question, whether or not the petitioners had attempted to file their return in FORM GST\nTRAN-1 on 27.12.2017, has not been examined by the Joint Commissioner in the impugned order .\n4. In the impugned order dated 27.06.2018, the Joint Commissioner rejected the petitioners' plea of server\nerror/technical difficulties in filing FORM GST TRAN-1 on 27.12.2017, holding that the statistics showedS.K.J.that several such returns were filed between 24.12.2017 and 27.12.2017; and there appeared to be no technical\nglitch/system related matter that prevented the petitioners from filing their TRAN-1 in time.\n5. The Department of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Ministry of Finance,\nGovernment of India issued notification No.48/2018 dated 10.09.2018 amending Rule 117 of CGST Rules\nand insert ed Clause (1A) thereto. It further inserted a proviso to Rule 117(4)(b)(iii). The amended Rule\n117(1A) and the proviso to Rule 1 17(4)(b)(iii) read thus:\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (1), the Commissioner may, on the recommendations of\nthe Council, extend the date for submit ting the declaration electronically in FORM GST TRAN-1 by a\nfurther period not beyond 31st March, 2019, in respect of registered persons who could not submit the\nsaid decla ration by the due date on account of technical difficulties on the common portal and in respect\nof whom the Council has made a recommendation for such extension.\"\n\"Provided that the registered persons filing the declaration in FORM GST TRAN-1 in accordance with\nsub-rule (1A), may submit the statement in FORM GST TRAN-2 by 30th April, 2019.\"\n6. In terms of the amendment brought about by Rule 117(1A) of the CGST Rule s, power has been conferred\non the Commissioner , on the recommendations of the GST Council, to extend the date for submitting the\ndeclaration electronically in FORM GST TRAN-1 by a further period not beyond 31.03.2019 in respect of\nregistered persons who could not submit the said declaration by the due date on account of technical\ndifficulties on the common portal, and in respect of whom the Council has made a recommendation for such\nextension.\n7. The very fact that the Government of India has, itself, issued a notification  amending the Rules is its\nrecognition of the fact that certain dealers were unable to electronically submit their declarations in FORM\nGST TRAN-1 on 27.12.2017. Pursuant to Notification No.48/2018, the Commissioner (GST) issued Order\nNo.4/2018-GST dated 17.09.2018 exercising his powers under Rule 117(1A) of the CGST Rules, to extend\nthe period for submitting the declarations in FORM GST TRAN-1 till 31.01.2019 for the class of registered\npersons who could not submit the declaration by the due date on account of technical difficulties on the\ncommon portal, and whose cases have been recommended by the Council.\n8. The petiti oners claim that their representation dated 14.03.2018, made by them to the GST Council, is still\npending consideration of the Council. It is wholly unnecessary for us to examine whether or not the inability\nof the petitioners to submit their return,  in FORM GST TRAN-1 by 27.12.2017, was on account of technical\nglitches or a server  error or any such other difficulties, as these are all matters for the 3rd respondent to\nexamine. The impugned order dated 27.06.2018 does not deal with the petitioners' claim of inability to file\ntheir return in FORM GST TRAN-1 on 27.12.2017 because of server error; and, instead, relies on general\nstatistics to justify rejection of the petitioners' claim to have made attempts to file FORM GST TRAN-1 on\n27.12.2017. Since the petitioners are entitled to have their case considered in accordance with law, and in\nterms of the notifications dated 10.09 .2018 and the order dated 17.09.2018 , the impugned order dated\n27.06.2018 is set aside.\n9. It is open  to the petitioners, in terms of the notification dated 10.09.2018 and the subsequent order dated\n17.09.2018, to seek recommendation of the GST Council for submission of FORM GST TRAN-1 within the\ntime frame stipulated in the order dated 17.09.2018, and to satisfy the authorities concerned that their attempts\nto file FORM GST TRAN-1 on 27.12.2017 failed because of a systems error or server related issues.\n10. Both the Writ Petitions are, accordingly , disposed of. Miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand\nclosed. There shall be no order as to costs.\n*In favour of assessee."}

The issues involve d in all the seven (7) writ petitions are one and the same. It is to be noted that\nW.P.Nos.1 1194, 11206 & 11263 of 2021 came to be filed against the order of Additional Commissioner , (GST\nAppeals) and W.P.Nos.1 1198, 17275, 28836 & 30292 of 2021 are filed against the order of Deputy\nCommissioner of Central T ax.\n3. W.P. No. 11194 of 2021, which is filed, against the order in Appeal No. GUN-GST -000-APP-001-20-21\nGST, dated 30-4-2020, wherein the order rejecting refund was upheld, is taken as a lead petition for the\npurpose of deciding the issues involved.\n4. In a nut-s hell, the facts in issue, are that there was a Memorandum of Understanding for the purpose of\nsupply of power between India and Bangladesh. The petitioner participated in the tender process floated by\nthe Bangladesh Power Development Board [for short, \"BPDB\"] and was awarded contract by BPDB, pursuant\nto which, a Letter of Intent for purchase of 250 MW electricity power , was issued on 7-8-2018. Thereafter , the\npetitioner entered into a Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with BPDB and started supplyingelectricity/electrical energy to BPDB in accordance with the Indian Electricity Act, 2003 and the Rules and\nRegulations made thereunder . The Central Electricity Regulatory Commissio n, which is a statutory body\nunder section 76 of the Electricity Act, 2003, framed Regulations and Guidelines on Cross Border Trade of\nElectricity (Guidelines for Import/Export (Cross Border) of Electricity , 2018). Necessary guidelines to that\neffect were issued on December , 2018. As per the Regulations, the participating entities in India, proposing to\nengage in cross border trade of electricity with neighbouring countries, shall first obtain approval of\ndesignated authority appointed by the Central Electricity Authority . The mate rial on record show that the\npetitioner , after obtaining approval from  the Central Electricity Authority , Ministry of Power , Government of\nIndia, entered into Power Purchase Agreement, with a unit in Bangladesh. It is needless to mention that the\nelectricity to be supp lied by the petition er to BPDB would be as per the dispatch schedule provided by BPDB\nand then injected to the Transmission Grid at the interconnection point located in Andhra Pradesh. Reading\nmeters would be installed at the place, where the electricity generated is injected into Inter\u00acState transmission\nline, so as to record the quantum of electricity that has been supplied by the petitioner to BPDB. The injected\nelectricity would then get transmitted from the interconnection point to Bohrompur substation, West Bengal,\nIndia, which is the 'Delivery Point' through an Inter -State transmission line. From the said point, the electricity\nwould be transmitted to Bangladesh through the cross border transmissio n line, between Bohrompur\nsubstation, India and Bheramara substation, Bangladesh.\n(a) The material on record further indicates that Regional Energy Account (REA) report is being issued on\nmonthly basis by the Southern Regional Power Committee, which is a unit of Central Electricity Authority of\nGovernment of India, indicating the number of units of electricity transmitted by each supplier of electricity to\na particular recipient. The report also identifies the destination to which electricity is supplied by the\npetitioner .\n5. The circumstances, which made the petitioner to file the writ petition, are:\u2014\n(a) Since export of electrical energy is treated as Zero rated supply under section 16 of IGST Act,\n2017, the petitioner applied for refund of unutilized Input Tax Credit through a refund claim by\nfiling application under Form GST RFD-01A in terms of section 54 of CGST Act, 2017 read with\nsection 16(3) of IGST Act, 2017.\n(b) On 17-5-2019, the third respondent issued a Memo, demanding the petitioner to file (1) Copy of\nInput Tax Credit Register; (2) Copy of Input Tax Credit Invoices and (3) A statement containing the\nnumber and date of shipping bills or bills of exports and the number and date of the relevant export\ninvoices. Except for the statement containing the number and date of shippi ng bills or bills of\nexport, the petitioner submitted all other documents including the Regional Energy Account\nshowing the units of electricity exported  as demanded in the memo. In so far as non- submission of\nthe shippin g bill, the petitioner addresse d a letter to third respondent, stating that shipping bill will\nnot be available and there is no requirement under the Customs Law, for filing of shipping bill or\nany simila r docume nts showing export of electrical energy as required for physical export of\ntangible goods. It is stated that generation and filing of shipping bill is not possible for transmission\nof electricity and there is no requirement for filing of any shipping bill or bill of export for electrical\nenergy.\n(c) On 28-6-2019, a Show Cause Notice was served on the petitioner , rejecting the claim for refund to\nan extent of Rs. 5,67,94,499/-, on the ground that as the Petitioner failed to submit shipping bill and\nExport General Manifest [EGM] along with refund application, evidencing delivery of electricity at\nBohrompur Station, the same cannot be termed as 'export of goods' under section 2(5) of the IGST\nAct. A detailed reply came to be filed by the petitioner on 24-7-2019 and a personal hearing was\nalso given. On 20-9-2019, the third respondent rejected the request for the month of March, 2019.\nAn appeal came to be filed before the second respondent reiterating the submissions.\n(d) On 30-4-2020, the impugned order came to be passed upholding the order -in-original, rejecting the\nclaim of refund on the following grounds (1) there is no provision of law , exempting the submission\nof shippin g bill in respect of export of electricity and that the sanctioning authority cannot extend\nan except ion which  is not there in the law; (2) Adjudicating Authority cannot be expected to\ncondone or overlook non-filing of shipping bill since they are not vested with such discretion power\nand (3) as the delivery point of electricit y is in India, it cannot be said that the impugned transaction\namounts to export of goods. Challenging the same, the present writ petitions came to be filed.6. From the above, it is clear that the request came to be rejected mainly on the two grounds. (1) The shipping\nbill, as required under rule 89(2)( b) of Centr al Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017, is not submitted to the\nauthorities and (2) There is no evidence to show that the power transmitted by the petitioner from Bohrompur\nSubstation, Murshidabad, India is the same power which reached Bheramara substation, Bangladesh.\n7. Coming to the first issue, namely , non-submission of the shipping bills, learned counsel for the petitioner\nwould contend that under rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017 application for refund of Input Tax Credit should be\naccompanied by statements containing the number and date of shipping bills or bills of export etc. According\nto him, in so far as transmission of electricity is concerned, it is impossible to generate such bills, as the\nsupply from one place to another place and from one country to another country  is only through transmission\nlines. In other words, his argument is that shipping bill is a custom document and the same cannot be made\napplicable to show supply of Electricity; which is intangible in nature.\n8. To substa ntiate that there was export of electricity , learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he has\nplaced other documents (REA reports), which amply establish the same. According to him, in a meeting held\non 18-2-2020, with the Ministry of Power , under the Chairmanship of the Central Electrical Authority , it was\ndecided that monthly Regional Energy Accounts [REAs] issued by the Regional Power Committee [RPC] can\nbe used as a document to establish proof of export in case of electricity . He also placed on record the\nNotification dated 5-7-2022 issued by the Government of India amending rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017,\nwhich gives clarification as to how the export of electricity can be proved.\n9. In so far as, the second issue is concern ed, learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that though in\nfirst three  cases, the authorities issued  show cause notice demanding proof, for export of electricity to\nBheramara substation, Bangladesh, but in subsequent notices issued for the months-June, 2019 to September ,\n2021, they realized their mistake and dropped the said issue in the notice. The very fact of dropping the\ndemand, with regard to filing of proof in respect of export of electricity in the subsequent notices, would show\nthat the authorities realized the impossibility in fulfiling the same and as such the same applies to earlier\nnotices as well. The learned counsel further submits that amendment to rule 89(2) of CGST Rules, should be\ngiven a retrospective ef fect as it is a beneficial legislature.\n10. A counter came to be filed by the second and third respondents, disputing the averments made in the\naffidavit filed in support of the writ petition. A reading of the counter shows that the documents produced by\nthe petitioner do not confirm export of goods, as defined in section 2( 5) of IGST Act. It is further urged that in\nthe absenc e of any material showing that the energy generated by the petitioner was the same energy which\nwas transmitted from India to Banglades h, and in the absence of any documents evidencing the same, in terms\nof rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017, the order impugned warrants no interference.\n11. In other words, the argument of Sri Suresh Kumar Routhu, learned Senior Stand ing Counsel for CBIC, for\nsecond and third respondents, appears to be that there is no separate procedur e to waive the requirement of\nproducing shipping bills as proof of export. He further submits that some of the writ petitions filed directly\nbefore this Court under article 226 of Constitution of India without availing the alternate remedy is bad in law.\nHe relied upon the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court in support of the same. He further submits that\nrejection for refund is made not only on the ground of procedural violation, but also on the ground that the\nsupply of electricity  by the petitioner does not constitute export of goods, as the delivery point is only up to a\nlocal area. Learned Standing Counsel further submits that the transmission of power supply by the petitioner\nstands established only till Bohrompur , West Bengal and not beyond that. Hence, they cannot claim any\nbenefit of refund of Input Tax credit. Learned Standing Counsel further submits that the petitioner has no\ndedicated electrical lines for transmissi on of electrical energy from their thermal plant to Bohrompur sub-\nstation and has no dedicated Internation al/Cross Border Transmission lines for transmission of electricity to\nBangladesh. The power is transmitted pursuant to an agreement with Central Electricity Authority under the\nsupervision of Government of India and as such, no benefit can be given for refund of input tax credit.\n12. An additional affidavit came to be filed on behalf of the second and third  respondents, referring to\nNotification, dated 5-7-2022, amending rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017 and the said notification being\npublished in the Gazette on 5-7-2022. Hence, submits that any relief to the petitioner can be extended only be\nafter 5-7-2022 and the same cannot be retrospective in operation.\n13. In the rejoinder filed by the petitione r, it is stated that the petitioner has not challenged the statutory\nprovision, but only prays that rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017 requiring production of shipping bills as proof of\nexport, is impossible to be fulfilled in their case, owing to its intangible nature.14. The point that arises for consideration is, whether the authorities were right in rejecting the refund claim\nmade by the petitioner?\n15. Before dealing with issues involved, learned counsel for Respondents raised an objection with regard to\nthe maintainability of writ petitions. He submits that, the present writ petitions are not maintainable, as some\nwrit petitions are filed against order -in-appeal and some are filed against order -in-original, without availing\nthe remedy provided under the statutory provisions and approached this court directly under Article 226 of the\nConstitution of India. He placed relian ce on \" Asstt. Commissioner of State Tax v. Commer cial Steel Ltd.\n[2021] 130 taxmann.com 180/52 GSTL 385/88 GST 799 (SC) \".\n16. Whe reas, learned counsel for the Petitio ner urged that though the remedy of filing of an appeal lies before\nthe GST Tribunal, but the same is not done, as the Tribunal is not yet constituted and that there was no\nefficacious or alternative remedy as on the date of filing of the writ petitions. It is further urged that when\nsome of the appeals filed before the Appellate Authority are rejected, against which, the writ petitions are\nfiled, no useful purpose would be served in preferring an appeal before the Appellate Authority again seeking\nthe very same relief. In these circumstances, it is pleaded that filing of writ petiti ons directly before this Court,\nquestioning the order -in-original cannot be said to be improper or incorrect. Having regard to the above\ncircumstances, learned counsel for the petitioner contends that order under challenge requires interference.\n17. It is well settled principle that this court can entertain writ petitions only in exceptional circumstances, as\nlaid down in Asstt. Commissioner of State Tax case [supra  1 cited]. The existe nce of an alternate remedy is\nalso not an absolute  bar to the maintainability of the writ petitions. Howeve r, coming to present case, as\nTribunal is not yet constituted by the GST Council and as there is no efficac ious remedy available to the\nPetitioner , except approaching this court, we are of the view that the writ petitions can be entertained.\nMoreover , the respondents' contention that the petitioner has to approach Tribunal under section 112 of CGST\nAct, when and where it is constituted, cannot be accepted as it may cause irreparable loss to the petitioner .\n18. With regard to the Writ Petitions filed against order -in-original, this court is inclined towards the\ncontention raised by the Petitioner , wherein it is urged that when appeals of similar issues are rejected by\nAppellate authority , it would serve no useful purpose to file the same again before the same authority , by the\nsame party , seeking the very same relief.\n19. Coming to the point for consideration and to appreciate the rival arguments advanced, on the legal issues\ninvolved, it would be appropriate to refer section 16 of IGST Act, 2017 which reads as under:\u2014\n(1) \"zero rated supply\" means any of the following supplies of goods or services or both, namely:\u2014\n(a) export of goods or services or both; or\n(b) supply of goods or services or both to a Special Economic Zone developer or a Special\nEconomic Zone unit.\n(2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (5) of sectio n 17 of the Central Goods and Services Tax\nAct, credit of input tax may be availed  for making zero-rated supplies, notwit hstanding that such\nsupply may be an exempt supply .\n(3) A registered person making zero rated supply shall be eligible to claim refund under either of the\nfollowing options, namely:\u2014\n(a) he may supply good s or services or both under bond or Letter of Undertaking, subject to\nsuch conditions, safeguards and proce dure as may be prescribed, without payment of\nintegrated tax and claim refund of unutilised input tax credit; or\n(b) he may supply goods or services or both, subject to such conditions, safeg uards and\nprocedure as may be prescribed, on payment of integrated tax and claim refund of such tax\npaid on goods or services or both supplied,\nin accordance with the provisions of section 54 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act or the rules\nmade thereunder .\nA reading of section 16(3) of IGST Act will clearly indicate that a person making zero-rated supply shall be\nentitled to the claim  under two options, mentioned in clauses (a) and (b). In so far as clause (b) is concerned,the claim would be in accordance with the provisions of section 54 of CGST Act and the Rules made\nthereunder .\n20. A perusa l of section 54 of CGST Act, 2017, which deal with claim for refund, would show that the\npetitioner is entitled to claim refund of Input Tax Credit. This provision nowhere refer to furnishing of\nshipping bill for claim of refund, which aspect is not disputed. However , the authorities only refer to rule 89\n2(b) of CGST Rules, 2017, for production of shipping bills, so as to accept the claim made. A situation of this\nnature would not have been contemp lated, at the time when rule 89 of CGST Rules was framed and\nincorporated in the statute book. The transmission of electricity across the border is a phenomena that has\ncome into existence from the recent past i.e. after incorporation of Rule 89, and as such, suitable amendments\nought to have been made at the time when permissions are granted for transmission of electricity to other\ncountries.\n21. Keeping this in the background, it is now to be seen (A) whether the petitio ner has supplied Electrical\nEnergy across the border? and (B) whether he is entitled for refund of Input Tax Credit? It is to be noted here\nthat the petitioner has been awarded a contract for supply of power pursuant to a tender floated by BPDB and\nthe Letter  of Intent for producing 250 MW of electricity power . The Power Purchase Agreements were\nentered into with BPDB and the petitioner started supply of energy. Initially , the supply was from 15-2-2018\nto December , 2019, but, on extension, the petitioner entered into a long term agreement with BPDB for supply\nof energy beginning  from 1-1-2020 to 31-7-2033. The supply of electricity by the petitioner is made as per the\nschedule, in terms of which, electricity is generated and injected into transmissi on grid at the interconnection\npoint located in Andhra Pradesh. The reading meters at the interconnection/injection points are erected, to\nrecord the supply of electricity by the petitioner . The injected electricity gets transmitted to Bohrompur sub-\nstation, Murshidabad District, West Bengal [delivery point] by the Interstate transmission lines of M/s. Power\nGrid Corporation of India Limited. From there, it reaches Bangladesh by cross border transmission line,\nbetween Bohrompur sub-station and Bheramara sub-station of Bangladesh, through Power Grid Company\nBangladesh. The material on record also shows that the actual units of electricity supplied by the petitioner to\nBangladesh is recorded in Regional Energy Account, issued on monthly basis, by Southern Regional Power\nCommittee, which is a unit of Central Electricity Authority in India. As the supply of electrical energy, is\ntreated as zero-rated supply , under section 16 of IGST Act, 2017, the petitioner applied for refund of\nunutilised input tax credit through a refund claim by filing applications in required forms. It is also not in\ndispute that the petitioner has generated  electrical energy and transmitted throug h transmission lines of Power\nCorporation of India and the same reached Bohrompur sub-station and transmi ssion to Bangladesh would be\nunder the supervision of Central Electricity Authority , which is a Government of India undertaking.\n22. At this stage, it is to be noted that out of seven writ petitions, three writ petitions came to be rejected on\ntwo grounds, namely:\u2014\n(a) the shipping bill which is required in terms of rule 89(2) of the CGST Rules, 2017 was not\nsubmitted, and\n(b) no material show that the petitioner has not exported electricity to Bangladesh, as the delivery point\nis only at Bohrompur in India.\nwhereas the other four writ petitions were rejected on the sole ground that bills were not produced by the\npetitioner .\n23. A perusal of the above rejection orders would show that the authorities have realized the mistake\ncommitted in insisting on production of material, evidencing export of ener gy to Bangladesh from the delivery\npoint in Bohrompur , West Bengal, and for the said reason, in the subsequent orders the refund claim was\nrejected only on the ground that shipping bills were not produced. In other word s, the subsequent show cause\nnotices, for the period June, 2019 to September , 2021 does not dispute export of energy to Bangladesh as the\nclaim came to be rejected due to non- production of shipping bills only. Hence, transmission to Bangladesh by\nthe petitio ner was accepted. Therefore, the argument of Sri Suresh Kumar Routhu, learned Standing Counsel\nthat the petitioner never transmitted ener gy across the border cannot be accepted as it is now verifiable.\n24. The next question, which falls for consideration would be with regard to rejecti on of refund claim for non-\nproduction of shipping bills in terms of rule 89(2)( h) of CGST Rules, 2017, which reads, as under:\u2014\n\"89(2)( h):- a statement containing the number and the date of the invoices received and issued during a\ntax period in a case where the claim pertains to refund of any unutilized input tax credit under sub-section(3) of section 54 where the credit has accumulated on account of the rate of tax on the inputs being higher\nthan the rate of tax on output supplies, other than nil-rated or fully exempt supplies.\"\n25. As stated earlier , the petitioner made multiple representations to various authorities, informing them about\nthe difficulty in producing shipping bills for export of electricity . The said issue was also raised before\nRegional Power Committee meeting, in which it was stated that REA reports made available by Regional\nPower Committee on monthly basis can be used as proof of export. It would be useful to extract the relevant\nportion, which is as under:\u2014\n\"9. After deliberations, following was concluded:\na. Total energy from a generation project may be sold through a single or more than one\ncontracts, which may include both 'export' and 'domestic sale'.\nb. Taxes are paid by the generators for various components of the inputs that are used in\ngeneration of electricity from their project. Therefore, the inputs need to be apportioned\nbetween 'exports' and 'domestic sale' for the purpose of allowing input tax credits.\nc. Regional Energy Accounts (REAs) which are made available by each Regional Power\nCommittee (RPC) on monthly basis, provide energy scheduled under each contract from a\nparticular generating station situated in their region. Thus, this scheduled energy as\navailable in REA can be used for proof of export of sale.\nd. However , it would be better to use the variable charge component of the bills, if available\nseparately , for proportionating the input tax credit between 'export' and 'domestic sale'. It\nwould still be better to proportionate the input tax credit on the basis of energy instead of\nrevenue.\"\n26. As observed earlie r, rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017, deals with a procedure for claiming refund. But,\nrequiring them to produce shipping bills, as proof of export cannot be made applicable to electricity , as it is\nimpossible to produce shipping bill for export of electricity , since the Custom Law does not refer to electricity\nand shippi ng bill is a Customs document. Export of electricity can only be through transmission line, but not\nthrough rail, road or water , for which, necessary documents can be made available.\n27. Pursuant to repeate d representations by Generators of Electrical Energy, and their negotiations with the\nCentral Authorities from the year 2020, fructified into a notification, which came to be issued in the month of\nJuly, 2022, amending rule 89 of CGST (Amendment) Rules, 2022, which reads as under:\n'8. In the said rules, in rule 89, -\n(a) in sub-rul e (1), after the fourth proviso, the following Explanation shall be inserted,\nnamely:-\n 'Explanation . \u2014For the purposes of this sub-rule, ?specified officer means a ?\"specified\nofficer\" or an ? \"authorised officer\" as defined under rule 2 of the Special Economic Zone\nRules, 2006.';\n(b) in sub-rule (2), -\n(i) in clause (b), after the words ?on account of export of goods, the words ?, other\nthan electricity shall be inserted;\n(ii) after clause ( b), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:\n\"(ba) a statement containing the number and date of the export invoices, details of energy\nexported, tariff per unit for export of electricity as per agreement, along with the copy of\nstatement of scheduled energy for exported electricity by Generation Plants issued by the\nRegional Power Committee Secretariat as a part of the Regional Energy Account (REA)\nunder clause (nnn) of sub- regulation 1 of Regulation 2 of the Central Electricity\nRegulatory Commis sion (Indian Electricity Grid Code) Regulations, 2010 and the copy of\nagreement detailing  the tariff per unit, in case where refund is on account of export of\nelectricity;\";(c) in sub-rule (4), the following Explanation  shall be inserted, namely:?\n\"Explanation . - For the purposes of this sub-rule, the value of goods exported out of India shall be taken\nas -\n(i) the Free on Board (FOB) value declared in the Shipping Bill or Bill of Export form, as the\ncase may be, as per the Shipping Bill and Bill of Export (Forms) Regulations, 2017; or\n(ii) the value declared in tax invoice or bill of supply , whichever is less.\";\n(d) in sub-rule (5), for the words \"tax payable on such inverted rated supply of goods and\nservices\", the brackets, words and letters \"(tax payable on such inverted rated supply of\ngoods and services x (Net ITC' ITC availed on inputs and input services)) .\" Shall be\nsubstituted;'\n28. A reading  of the above amendment, inter alia , makes it clear that the petitioner herein  can now prove the\nquantity of electricit y transmitted basing on the statement of scheduled energy for export of electricity issued\nby Regional Power Committee [RPC] Secretariat, as a part of Regional Energy Account [REA] under clause\n(nnn) of sub-regulation (1) of regulation (2) of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.\n29. Furth er, the amendm ent to Rule 89(2)( ba) of CGST (Amendm ent) Rules, 2022 [July , 2022] clearly show\nthat the number and date of the export invoices, details of energy exported, tariff per unit of export as per\nagreement, along with the copy of scheduled energy for exported electricity by Generation Plants, issued by\nthe Regional Power Committee Secretariat, can be made the basis to show the number of units of electricity ,\ntransmitted and supplied across the border . This amendment makes it clear that information relating to\ngeneration of electrical energy and its transmission across the border , can be obtained from Regional Power\nCommittee Secretariat or Regional Ener gy Account under the regulations of Central Regulatory Committee.\n30. The situation remin ds of an age old maxim 'Lex Non Cogit ad impossibilia' , meaning that the law does not\ncompel a man to do things which he cannot possibly perform.\n31. Dealing with the aspect of impossibility of compliance, in Wipro Ltd. v. Union of India [2013] 32\ntaxmann.com 1 13/39 STT 639/29 STR 545 , the High Court of Delhi, held as under:\u2014\n\"9. We are of the view that there is a good deal of force in what the appellant says. Any condition\nimposed by the notification must be capable of being complied with. If it is impossible of compliance,\nthen there  is no purpose behind it. The appellant is in the business of rendering  IT-enabled services such\nas technica l support services, customer -care services, back-of fice services etc. which are considered to be\n\"business auxiliary services\" under the Finance Act, 1994 for the purpose of levy of service tax. The\nnature of the services is such that they are rendered on a continuous basis without any commencement or\nterminal points; it is a seamless service. It involves attending to cross-border telephone calls relating to a\nvariety of queries from existing or prospective customers in respect of the products or services of\nmultinational corporations. The appellant's unit in Okhla is one of those places which are popularly\nknown as \"Call Centres\"-business process outsourcing (BPO) centres. The wealth of skilled, English-\nspeaking, computer -savvy youth in our country are a great source of manpower required by the\nmultinational corpor ations for such services. The BPO centres become very active from evening because\nof the time-dif ference between India and the European and American continents . The mainstay of the call\ncentres is a sophis ticated computer system and a technically strong and sophisticated international\ntelephone network. The service consists of providing information relating to the products and services of\nthe MNCs , queries relating to maintenance and after-sales services, providing  telephonic assistance in\ncase of glitches during operating the consumer -products or while utilising the services and so on. For\ninstance, the customer sitting in USA has a problem operating a washing machine sold to him by an\nAmerican company . When he calls the company , the local telephone number would be linked to the call\ncentre number in India and it will actually be an employee of the Indian call centre who would answer the\nqueries and assist the customer in USA  get over the problem. Another example could be of a person in\nUSA wanting to book an international air-ticket from an airline; his queries over the phone will be\nanswered by the employee of the Indian call centre, sitting in some place in India. The American\nmanufacturer of the washing machine or the American airline company is the source of revenue for the\nIndian call centre or BPO centre.13. All the lower authorities, including the CEST AT, are unanimous in their view that the requirement,\nthough one of procedure, is nevertheless inflexible as it is conceived with a view to preventing the\nevasion of service tax and dispensing with the same would deprive the service tax authorities from\ncarrying out the necessary preventive  and audit-checks. The correctness of this view , as a broad\nproposition, need not be decided in this case. The question here is one of impossibility of compliance\nwith the requirement. If, having regard to the nature of the business and its peculiar features-which are\nnot in dispute-the description, value and the amount of service tax and cess payable on input-services\nactually required to be used in providing  the taxable service to be exported are not determinable prior to\nthe date of export but are determinable only after the export and if, further , such particulars are furnished\nto the service tax authorities within a reasonable time along with the necessary documentary evidence so\nthat their accuracy and genuineness may be examined, and if those particulars are not found to be\nincorrect or false or unauthenticated or unsupported by documentary evidence, we do not really see how\nit can be said that the object and purpose of the requirement stand frustrated . In the present case, no\nirregularity or inaccuracy or falsity in the figures furnished by the appellant both on 5-2-2007 and in the\nrebate claims has been alleged. Moreover , it appears to us somewhat strange that none of the authorities\nbelow has demonstrated as to how the appellant could have complied with the requirement prior to the\ndate of the export of the IT -enabled services.\"\n32. In PVR Ltd.  v. State of Telangana  [W.P. No. 1008 of 2019, dated 6-9-2019], the High Court of Telangana,\nobserved as under:\u2014\n\"11. Logically , the Film Development Corporation would not be in a position to issue such a certificate\nwithout knowing the number of prints of the movie that had been released. As already noted  supra , a low\nbudget feature film was one where the number of prints was less than 35. This fact could only be\nascertained after release of the movie and not prior thereto. In effect, the condition was practically\nimpossible to perform.\n12. Significantly , the petitioner comp any asserted that it was alone being singled out for this\ndiscriminatory treatment and other similarly situated theatres were allowed to furnish the certificates\nfrom the Film Development Corporati on later and not in advance. This assertion by the petitioner\ncompany was not rebutted by the third respondent in. her counter -affidavit. No explanation is\nforthcoming even now as to why the petitioner company alone is being picked upon for violation of the\ncondition of furnishing the certificates in advance. The third respondent also does not dispute, that the\ncertificates were produced by the petitioner company after release of the movies and there is no\nshortcoming or lacuna in this regard. If that is so, mere failure on the part of the petitioner company to\nproduce such certificates in advance, which it could not have done in any event, is not a ground to deny it\nthe benefit of G.O. Ms. No. 604 dated 22-4-2008. The assessment orders, which proceeded only on the\npremise that such benefit could not be extended to the petitioner company owing to belated production of\nthe certificates, therefore cannot be countenanced.\"\n33. In Commissioner of Customs  v. Frontier Aban Drilling (India) Ltd. 2010 (254) ELT 63, the Madras High\nCourt observed as under:\u2014\n\"4. We have carefully considered the arguments of the learned Counsel for the appellant and perused the\nmaterials available on record as well as the orders of the lower Authorities. No such condition has been\nimposed or stated to be imposed in the Notification. It is the admitted case of the Department that the\nblow out preventer and its accessories were immersed in the deep water of the sea and became\nirretrievable. Hence , the importer cannot be directed to perform the function, which is impossible of\nperformance. It is a different matter if it is the case of the Department that the importer retrieved the\nsheared off part of the drill ship and diverted it for some other purpose. On the contrary , it is the admitted\ncase of the Department that the blow out preventer has been sheared off and immersed in the deep water\nof the sea, which is irretrievable. That was the reason given by the Tribunal for confirming the order of\nthe Commissioner of Customs, who set aside the proposal of the Department to recover a sum of Rs.\n5,75,84,140/- and for imposition of penalty. We do not find any merit in this case so as to entertain the\nappeal in the above stated facts and circumstances of the case.\"\n34. Having to the above discussion and the judgments referred to above, we hold that the rule 89 of CGST\nRules, 2017 and the amendment made thereto cannot curtail the benefit of Input Tax Credit. The petitioner , in\nour view, was justif ied in not producing shipping bills to prove the quantity of energy units transmitted andthat the reports of REA filed by the petitioner , could be made the basis to deal with the claim for refund of\nInput T ax Credit.\n35. At this stage, Sri Suresh Kumar Routhu, learned Senior Standing Counsel for CBIC submits that the\namendment/notification issued by the Government of India on 5-7-2022 to rule 89(3) of CGST (Amendment)\nRules, 2022 cannot be made retrospe ctive in operation, more so, when the notification in the Gazette\npostulates that it will come into ef fect from 5-7-2022.\n36. On the other hand, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though the amended Rule came into\neffect from 5-7-2022 but since this being a clarificatory and beneficial legislation, it has to be given\nretrospective ef fect.\n37. The issue that props up now for adjudication at this stage is to whether amended rule 89(2) of CGST\nRules, 2022 is clarificatory or declaratory?\n38. Circular No.175/07/2022-GST dated 06-7-2022 issued by Ministry of Finance, Government of India, with\nregard to the manner of securing refund of unutilized ITC on account of export of electricity , is as under:\u2014\n\"Reference has been received from Ministry of Power regarding the problem  being faced by power\ngenerating units in filing of refund of unutilised Input Tax Credit (ITC) on account of export of\nelectricity . It has been represented that though electricity is classified as \"goods\" in GST, there is no\nrequirement for filing of Shipping Bill/Bill of Export in respect of export of electricity . However , the\nextant provisions under rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017 provided for requirement of furnishing the details\nof shipping bill/bill of export in respect  of such refund of unutilised ITC in respect of export of goods.\nAccordingly , a clause (ba) has been inserted in sub-rule (2) of rule 89 and a Statement 3B has been\ninserted in FORM GST RFD-01 of the CGST Rules, 2017  vide notification No. 14/2022-CT dated 5th\nJuly, 2022. In order to clarify various issues and procedure for filing of refund claim pertaining to export\nof electricity , the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168(1) of the CGST Act, hereby\nprescribes the following procedure for filing and processing of refund of unutilised ITC on account of\nexport of electricity .\"\nThe above  Circular clearly establishes that amendment to rule 89 of CGST (Amendment) Rules, 2022 was\ncarried out to cure the defect in rule 89 of CGST Rules, 2017, because of the problem faced by power\ngenerating units in filing refund claims of unutilised Input T ax Credit on export of electricity .\n39. Further , a perusal of the amendment to rule 89(2) of CGST Rules, would inter-alia show that the said Rule\ncame to be amended only to clarify the anomaly that was existing with regard to production of material\nevidencing export of a thing which is intangible in nature. This clarification came to be made since the\nsituation namely transmission of energy could not have been visualized when rule 89(2) was incorporated in\nthe Statute book. Production of shipping  bills will not prove or establish by any means the quantity of energy\ntransmitted. Hence, by no stretch of imagination, the amendment can be said to be declaratory in nature, but it\ncan only be a one, which would be curing the defect by issuing necessary clarification as to how transmission\nof electrical ener gy can be proved.\n40. Hence, we are of the view that the rule 89 of CGST (Amendment) Rules, 2022 is only clarificatory in\nnature.\n41. When amendment/notification dated 5-7-2022 issued by Government of India is held to be curative or\nclarificatory in nature, the question now would be whether the said clarification is retrospective in nature?\n42. A proviso, which is inserted to remedy unintended consequences and to make the provision workable, a\nproviso which supplies an obvious omission in the section and is required to be read into the section to give\nthe section a reasonable interpretation, requires to be treated as retrospective in operation so that a reasonable\ninterpretation can be given to the section as a whole. [R.B. Jodh a Mal Kuthiala  v. CIT [1971] 82 ITR 570\n(SC)  .\n43. In CIT v. Alom Extrusions Ltd. [2009] 185 Taxman 416/319 ITR 306/2 27 ITR 417 (SC)/[2010] 1 SCC\n489, the Parlia ment has explicitly stated that Finance Act, 2003, will operate with effect from 1st April, 2004,\nbut the matter before the Court involved  the principle of construction with regard to the provisions of Finance\nAct, 2003. Referring to judgment of CIT v. J.H. Gotla [1985] 23 Taxman 14J/156 ITR 323/[19 86] 48 CTR\n363, the Hon'b le Suprem e Court held that the Finance Act, 2003, to the extent indic ated above, should be read\nas retrospective. In fact, in J.H. Gotla  case [supra 6 cited], the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed:-ANURAG\"We should find out the intention from the language used by the Legislature and if strict literal\nconstruction leads to an absurd result, i.e., a result not intend ed to be subserved by the object of the\nlegislation found in the manner indicated before, then if another construction is possible apart from strict\nliteral construction, then that constructi on should be preferred to the strict literal construction. Though\nequity and taxation are often strangers, attempts should be made that these do not remain always so and if\na construction results in equity rather than in injustice, then such construction should be preferred to the\nliteral construction.\"\n44. The Constitutional Bench of Hon'ble  Supreme Court in CIT v. Vatika Township (P.) Ltd. [2014] 49\ntaxmann.com 249/227 Taxman 121/367 ITR 466/271 CTR 1 (SC)/[2015] 1 SCC 1 while deciding the\nquestion as to whether the insertion of proviso to Section 113 by Finance Act, 2002 is retrospective, discussed\nthe general principles concerning retrospectivity . The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:\u2014\n\"30. We would also like to point out, for the sake of completeness, that where a benefit is conferred by a\nlegislation, the rule against a retrospective construction is different. If a legisla tion confers a benefit on\nsome persons but without inflicting a corresponding detriment on some other  person or on the public\ngenerally , and where to confer such benefit appears to have been the legislators' object, then the\npresumption would be that such a legislation, giving it a purposive construction, would warrant it to be\ngiven a retrospective effect. This exactly is the justification to treat procedural provisions as\nretrospective. In Govt. of India  v. Indian T obacco Assn.  [(2005) 7 SCC 396] , the doctrine of fairness was\nheld to be relevant factor to construe a statute conferring a benefit, in the context of it to be given a\nretrospective operation. The same doctrine of fairness, to hold that a statute was retrospective in nature,\nwas applie d in Vijay v. State of Maharas htra [(2006) 6 SCC 289] . It was held that where a law is enacted\nfor the benefit of community as a whole, even in the absence of a provision the statute may be held to be\nretrospective in nature. However , we are (sic not) confronted with any such situation here.\"\n45. It is well settled law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation until its language is\nsuch that would require such conclusion. The exception to this rule is enactments dealing with procedure. This\ncourt held that the law of limitation, being a procedural law, is retrospective in operation in the sense that it\nwill also apply to the proceedings pending at the time of enactment as also to the proceedings commenced\nthereafter , notwithst anding that the cause of action may have arisen before the new provisions came into\nforce. However , the Court held that there is an exception to the rule also, where the right of suit is barred\nunder the law of limitation in force before the new provision came into operation and a vested right has\naccrued to another , the new provision cannot revive the barred right or take away the accrued vested right. [T.\nKaliamurthi  v. Five Gori Thaikkal W akf [2008] 9 SCC 306].\n46. From the judgmen ts referred to abov e, it is very clear that any benefit that gets accrued by way of\nlegislation cannot be denied/curtailed, more so, when it is clarificatory in nature like the present one and as\nsuch it has to be made retrospective in operation.\n47. The petitioner's contention on the retro spective operation is also substantiated by the department action\nthrough the deficiency memo dated 7-7-2022 issued by the Assistant Commissi oner, Nellore Division, for the\nrefund claim filed for the period January , 2022 to March, 2022. The deficiency memo has advised the\nPetitioner to resubmit the refund application as prescribed  vide CBIC Circular No. 175/07/2022-GST dt.06-7-\n2022 along with all supporting documents. Copy of the refund claim in RFD-01 filed on 23-6-2022 along with\ndeficiency memo dated 7-7-2022 is submitted before this Court along with a memo in USR No. 42132 of\n2022 dated 15-7-2022.\n48. From the above, it is clear that the department has applied the Notification No. 14/2022 - Central Tax\ndated 5-7-2022 even for the refund claim filed for the period prior to 4-7-2022 acknowledging the amendment\nas retrospective in operation.\n49. Accordingly , these writ petitions are allowed and the orders under challenge are set aside and the\nW.P.Nos.1 1194, 11206 & 11263 of 2021 are remanded back to Additional Commissioner [GST Appeals] and\nthe W.P.Nos.1 1198, 17275, 28836 & 30292 of 2021 are remanded back to the Deputy Commissioner of\nCentral Tax to deal with the claim of refund in terms of this common order . The petitioner shall file relevant\nreports evidencing transmission of electricity before appropriate authorities, if not already filed.

Nar endra Chetty , Ld. Counsel for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \n1. Heard Sri G.Narendra Chetty , learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Government Pleader for\nCommercial T ax for the respondents.\n2. The challe nge in the writ petition is to the order , dated 31-3-2022, which is a combined assessment order\nfor tax, penalty and interest, passed by the 1st respondent for the assessment period from 1-7-2017 to 31-3-\n2020 for the financi al year 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 & 2020-21. Inter alia , the main  thrust of argument of\nlearned counsel for the petitioner is that no show cause notice was issued in terms of Rule 142 (1A) of the\nCentral Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Rules, 2017, as per which, the proper officer shall, before service of\nnotice to the person chargeable with tax, interest and penalty , under sub-Section (1) of section 73 or sub-\nsection (1) of sectio n 74, as the case may be, communicate the details of any tax, interest and penalty asascertained by the said officer, in Part A of Form GST DRC-01A. It is argued, in the said provision, which\nstood before amendment with effect from 15-10-2020, the word 'shall' is employed and therefore, issuance of\ncommunication before the service of notice under section 74(1) is mandatory in terms of Rule 142 (1A) of the\nCGST Rules.\n3. Learned counsel would further submit that as the major part of the tax demanded relates to pre-amendment\nperiod of Rule 142(1A) of the CGST Rules, the 1st respondent should issue communication to the person\nchargeable with tax in terms of un-amended Rule 142(1A) of CGST Rules, but in the instant case, the said\ncommunication was not made to the petitioner . In view of the said violation, the petitioner lost a valuable\nopportunity to make his submission, even before the issuance of notice under section 74(1) of CGST/APGST .\nDue to violation of Rule, he would argue, the impugned order fell foul of law and therefore, the same is liable\nto be set aside and fresh communication may be directed to be issued in terms of Rule 142(1A) of\nCGST/APGST Rules to enable the petitioner to submit his reply .\n4. When enquired, the learned Government Pleader , while opposing the writ petition, would submit that the\n3rd respondent, at first issued Form GST DRC-01A intimation to the petitioner under Rule 142(1A) of CGST\nRules for the assessment period from July 2017 & 2018-19 on 22-9-2020 but no action has been taken by him\npursuant to the aforesaid notice. While so, some time thereafter , the concerned file was transferred to the 1st\nrespondent, who issued a show cause notice in FORM GST DRC-01 under section 74(1) of APGST Act, 2017\nto the petitioner on 5-11-2021 for the period from 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021 and thereafter no further action was\ntaken. Learned Government Pleader would further submit that the petitioner filed a reply on 22-12-2021 and\nthereafter , the 1st respondent passed the impugned assessment order , dated 31-3-2022, narrating the\nirregularity in payment of GST .\n5. Learned Government Pleader has fairly admitted that after receiving the file, the 1st respondent straight\naway issued notice under section 74(1)  of APGST Act, 2017 on 5-11-2021 in FORM GST DRC-01 for the\nassessment period from 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021, but he did not issue the intimation under Rule 142(1A) of\nCGST Rules before issuing show cause notice under section 74(1) of APGST Act, 2017. However , learned\nGovernment Pleader sought to support the action of the 1st respondent on the ground that some part of the\nperiod covered under the notice dated 5-1 1-2021 was relating to the post amendment period.\n6. Learned Governmen t Pleader would further submit that Rule 142(1A) of CGST Rules, 2017 was amended\nwith effect from 15-10-2020. In Rule (1A), for the words 'proper officer shall', the 'proper officer may' has\nbeen subst ituted and in that view , the issuance of intimation under Rule 142(1 A) is only a discretion on the\npart of the concerned authority , but not mandatory .\n7. Referring to the said Rule 142(1A) of the CGST Rules, 2017 and also referring to the assessment period\ni.e., 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021, learned Government Pleader would submit that some part of the tax period from\n15-10-2020 to 31-3-2021 relates to post amendment period, for which issuance of intimation is not mandatory\nand thus supported the action of the 1st respondent.\n8. The point for consid eration is, whether the impugned assessment order , dated 31-3-2022, passed by the 1st\nrespondent is invalid for the reason that show cause notice dt.05-1 1-2021 was issued straight away , without\nissuing a prior intimation under Rule 142 (1A) of CGST Rules, 2017?\nPOINT :\n9. We perused the notice issued at first by the 3rd respondent and later by the 1st respondent and the\nimpugned order passed by him and also the relevant provision under Rule 142(1A) of CGST Rules, 2017.\n10. For convenience, it is expedient to extract Rule 142 (1A) as it stood prior to the amendment which reads\nthus:\n\"the proper officer shall, before service of notice to the person chargeable with tax, interest and penalty ,\nunder sub-section (1) of section 73 or sub-section (1) of section 74, as the case may be, shall\ncommunicate the details of any tax, interest and penalty as ascertained by the said officer, in Part A of\nFORM GST DRC-01A.\"\n11. Thus, as can be seen, prior to the amendment, Rule 142(1A) of CGST Rules, 2017 reads that the proper\nofficer shall, before service of notice on the person chargeable with tax, interest and penalty under section\n73(1) or 74(1) of CGST/APGST Act, communicate him the details of tax, interest and penalty as ascertained\nby the said officer in FORM GST DRC-01. The employment of the word 'shall' in Rule 142(1A) wouldKEV ALindicate that the officer shall necessarily follow the procedure prescribed under Rule 142(1A) of the Act,\nmeaning thereby , an intimation of tax shall be issued in terms of Rule 142(1A) at first and if there is no\nresponse from the tax payer , then he can issue a show cause notice under section 74(1) of CGST/APGST Act.\n12. Be that at it may, Rule 142(1A) of CGST Rules, 2017 has been amended as stated  supra  by virtue of\nnotification No. 79/2020-CT dt.15-10-2 020 and by virtue of the said amendm ent, the words 'proper officer\nshall' has been substituted with the words 'proper officer may' as appearing in Rule 142(1A). Thus, post\namendment, the issuance of intimation under Rule 142(1A) is not mandatory , but discretionary on the part of\nthe assessing authority .\n13. Be that as it may, admittedly , the 3rd respondent promptly issued FORM GST DRC-01A in terms of Rule\n142(1A) on 22-9-2020 to the petitioner for the tax period 2017-18 and 2018-19  and subsequently the file was\ntransferred to the 1st respondent and he straight away issued show cause notice on 5-11-2021 under FORM\nGST DRC-01 in terms of section 74(1) of APGST for the tax period from 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021. However ,\nadmittedly , he did not take any further action in that regard.\n14. Needless to emphasize the aforesaid tax demand covers both the pre-amended and post-amended period of\nRule 142(1A) of CGST Rules. It appears that the petitioner submitted a reply dt.22-1 1-2021 and thereafter the\nimpugned assessment order dated 31-3-2022 came to be passed by the 1st respondent.\n15. In this backdrop, now the contention of the petitioner is mainly against the show cause notice dt.05-1 1-\n2021 issued by the 1st respondent for the tax period 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021. His contention is that since the\nsaid show cause notice covers both pre-amended and post-amended period, the 1st respondent ought to have\nissued a tax intimation under Rule 142(1A) before issuing the impugned show cause notice dt.05-1 1-2021 and\nsince the said tax intimation had not preceded the show cause notice, the impugned assessment order fell foul\nof law. The submiss ion of the learned Government Pleader , as noted  supra  is that, since some part of the tax\nperiod relates to the post amendment period of Rule 142(1A) and issuance of show cause notice was also\nsubsequent to the amendment to Rule 142(1A), non issuance of tax intimation will not hit the assessment\norder .\n16. On a conspectus, we are unable to agree with the submission of learned Government Pleader for the\nreason that admittedly show cause notice dt.05-1 1-2021 covers the tax period 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021, meaning\nthereby , it covers both pre and post-am ended Rule 142(1A). However , most of the tax period relates to the\npre-amended period of Rule 142(1A). In that view , though the 3rd respondent issued tax intimation for the\nperiod from 2017-19 , since no action has been taken thereafter , the 1st respon dent after taking reigns of the\nfile, ought  to have issued the tax intim ation under Rule 142 (1A) (pre-amend ed) for the entire period and\nthereafter only ought to have issued show cause notice under section 74(1) of the CGST/APGST Act.\n17. It is a trite law that whenever any ambig uity arises with regard to any provision, the benefit must go to the\ntax payer . In the instant case, since admittedly the tax period related to 1-7-2017 to 31-3-2021 which covers\nthe pre and post amended period of Rule 142(1A), in our considered view , the 1st respondent ought to have\nissued tax intimation to the petitioner under Rule 142 (1A). Since it was not done, as rightly argued by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner , the assessment order , dated 31-3-2022, fell foul of law and is liable to be set\naside.\n18. Acco rdingly , the writ petition is allowe d and the impugned assessment order , dated 31-3-2022, passed by\nthe 1st respondent is set aside with a direction to the 1st respondent to issue a fresh tax intimation to the\npetitioner in terms of Rule 142(1A) (pre amended Rule 142 (1A)) within two weeks from the date of receipt\nof copy of this Order and take up further course of action as per law and pass appropriate orders. No costs.\nAs a sequel, miscellaneous applications, pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

This writ petition under  Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed for the following relief :-\n\"It is, therefore, prayed that this Hon'b le Court may be pleased to issue  an appro priate writ, order or\ndirection more particularly one in the nature of Writ of Mandamus the order in Form GST ADT -02 inReference No. AD371022001269J/GSTIN:37ABYPM0979P1ZD, dated 29-9-2023 issued  by the\nrespondent No. 3 on behalf of the respondent No. 2 under  Rule 101(5) of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and\nService Tax Rules, 2017 levying a tax of Rs. 17,36,445/- (Rupees Seventeen Lakhs Thirty Six Thousand\nFour Hundred and Forty Five) along with the interest of Rs. 9,61,673/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs Sixty One\nThousand Six Hundred and Seventy Three) for the financial years 2017-2018 to 2021-2022 without even\nconsidering the reply submitted by the petitioner and one without jurisdiction contrary to the provisions\nof Section  65 of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 and consequential notice  in Form\nGST DRC -01 in Case Id No. AD AD371022001269J/27-12-2022, dated 29-9-2023 proposing action\nunder  section  73/74 of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 as arbitrary , illegal,\nprincipals of natural justice, one without jurisdiction and contrary to the provisions of the Andhra\nPradesh Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 and the Rules issued  there under  apart from being violative of\nthe Fundamental and Constitutional Rights guaranteed to the petitioner under  Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300-\nA of the Constitution of India and consequently  set aside  the Order in Form GST ADT02 in Reference\nNo. AD3710220012 69J/GSTIN37ABYPM0979P1ZD, dated 29-9-2023 and consequential notice  in\nForm GST DRC-01 in Case Id No. AD AD371022001269J/27-12-2022, dated 29-9-2023 and pass such\norder or orders as are deemed fit and proper in the circumstances of the case.\"\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner subm its that the show  cause  notice  for audit  under  section  65 (3) & Rule\n101 (4), though dated 4-9-2023, but was uploaded on 14-9-2023. The petitio ner had no 'not less than 15\nworking days' of statutory period to file the response. The response was sent on 28-9-2023, within the\nstatutory period, but without considering  the petitioner's response, within the period of 15 days, the audit  was\nconducted and the report  dated 29-9-2023 was submitted. Based on such report , the show  cause  notice  under\nsection  73 has been issued  on 29-9-2023 itself. There is violation of the principles of natural justice as also the\nmandatory statutory provisions.\n5. On 16-1 1-2023, this Court had passed the following order:-\n\"Heard Sri B. Abhay Siddhanth Mootha, learned counsel for the petitioner .\n2. While challenging the impugned show  cause  notice  dated 29-9-2023 (Ex.P1), learned coun sel for the\npetitioner submits that a notice  (Ex.P9) dated 4-9-2 023 calling objections on the discrepancy was served\non 14-9-2 023, and before the petitioner could file the reply , within the statutory period of 15 days the\norder was passed on 29-9-2023. He has referred to Ex.P12 in which \"the notice  issued  date is 14-9-2023\".\nHe has also referred to his reply dated 28-9-2023 to submit that the notice  was served on 14-9-2023,\nthough it is dated 4-9-2023.\n3. The audit  proceedings were initiated pursuant to the previously issued  show  cause  notice  dated 21-10-\n2022. However , his submission is that pursuant to the notice  dated 4-9-2023 served on 14-9-2023, clear\n15 days time was required to be given to the petitioner in view of Section  65(3) of the Andhra Pradesh\nGoods and Services T ax Act, 2017 (in short, the Act 2017).\n4. His further submission is that the petitioner's registration was cancelled on 1-5-2022 and in view of\nSection  65 of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (in short, the Act), the audit  could\nnot be undertaken against the petitioner , as the petitioner ceased to be a registe red person on the date of\nservice of the first notice . He has placed reliance in the case of Tvl. Raja Stores v. Assistant\nCommissioner (ST), of the Madras High Court that in such a circumstance, the audit  could not be\ninitiated.\n5. He further submits that in any case the audit  shou ld have been completed within 3 months from the\ndate of its initiation  but that period expired and there was no permission/exte nsion by the Competent\nAuthority . Consequently , based on such audit  report , the impugned show  cause  notice  could not be\nlegally issued .\n6. Learned Government Pleader submit s that the petitioner has got opportunity to submit the objections\npursuant to the impugned show  cause  notice  and the notice  under  section  73 of the Act has also been\nissued  which are impugned. He submits that all these objections as are being raised here, can be raised\nbefore the Authority pursuant to the notices  issued .\n7. With respect to the petitioner's contention that the petitioner became unregistered after cancellation of\nthe registration, learned Government Pleader submits that in view of the provisio ns of Sections  25 and 29\nof the Act the period of audit , being the period of registration , such audit  could be legally made.8. With respect to the submission of time of completion of audit , learned Government Pleader submits\nthat in view of Section  65, itself it cannot be said that the audit  was not completed  within statutory\nperiod.\n9. At prese nt, what we find, prima facie , is that though the notice  Ex.P 9 is dated 4-9-2023 and the period\nmentioned there under  for the petitioner to file the reply was 15 days on receipt of notice , but the\npetitioner's case is that the notice  was recei ved on 14-9-2023, which, prima facie  is also so evident from\nEx.P12, said to be a document of the respondent authorities, and consequently , let the instructions be\nobtained by the learned Government Pleader with respect to the date of issue  and recei pt of the notice\ndated 4-9-2023 by the petitioner .\n10. Keeping all the aforesaid submissions/objections open, the matter is listed on 20-11-2023 in the\n'Motion List', for instructions as aforesaid.\"\n6. On 16-1 1-2023, time was granted to the respondent's counsel to obtain instructions.\n7. Sri T. C. D. Sekhar , submits today that the notice  is dated 4-9-2023 but the same was revised on 4-9-2023\nitself. The unrevised  notice  was uploaded on 4-9-2023. However , the revised notice  was uploaded on 14-9-\n2023. He submits that the report  of the audit  is pursuant to the revised notice . He submits that the petitioner\nsent the reply dated 28-9-2023 which was received on 3-10-2023 and consequently could not be considered.\n8. Learned Governme nt Pleader however , submits that in view of Section  73 of Andhr a Pradesh  Goods and\nService Tax Act, 2017, the show  cause  notice  can be issued  independent of the Audit  Report . Consequently ,\neven now the petitioner has opportunity to file response/objections, if any, before the authority pursuant to the\nshow  cause  notice .\n9. We have considered the submissions advanced and perused the material on record.\n10. Section  65 of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services T ax Act, 2017 (in short, the Act) reads as under :-\n\"Section  65(3):-\nThe registered person shall be informed, by way of a notice  not less than fifteen working days prior  to the\nconduct of audit  in such manner as may be prescribed.\"\n11. Section  65 (3) of the Act clearly provides  that the registered person shall be infor med by way of a notice\nnot less than fifteen working days prior to the conduct of audit  in such manner as may be prescribed.\n12. Rule  101 (4) of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (in short, the Rules 2017) reads\nas under :-\n\"Rule 101(4):-\nThe prope r officer may inform the registered person of the discrepancies noticed , if any, as observed in\nthe audit  and the said person  may file his reply and the proper officer shall finalise the findings of the\naudit  after due consideration of the reply furnished.\"\n13. Rule  101 (4) of the Rules, 2017, thus also provides  that the proper officer may inform the registered\nperson of the discrepancies noticed , if any, as observed  in the audit  and the said person  may file his reply and\nthe proper of ficer shall finalise the findings of the audit , after due consideration of the reply furnished.\n14. From the aforesaid provisions, it is evident that the notice  of inform ation that the audit  will be conducted\nis to be given to the registered person and such notice  shall be not less than 15 working days, prior to the\nconduct of audit . The registered person is granted oppor tunity to file reply and the proper officer shall finalize\nthe findings of the audit  after due consideration of the reply furnished. So, before finalizing the findings  of the\naudit , with respect to the discrepancies as noticed  for which notice  is given the reply  is filed, is to be\nconsidered. These provisions are towards complying with the principles of natural justice embodied in the\nstatute.\n15. In the present case, as mentioned above, the notice  does not comply with sub-section  (3) inasmuch as\nthere is no clear 'not less than 15 working days' time prior to the conduct of audit . The audit  has been finalized\non 29-9-2023 based on the revised notice , which notice  though revised on 4-9-2023 itself, but was uploaded\non 14-9-2023. As such the registered dealer had the information of the notice  on 14-9-2 023. From  that date\nupto 29-9-2023, there are no clear 15 working days. The findings have been finalized by the Audit  OfficerAJAYwithin the statutory notice  period, without waiting for completion of the statutory notice  period. The\npetitioner's reply is dated 28-9-2023, which though reached on 3-10-2023, was submitted within the statutory\nperiod, and even it be taken that it could not reach in time, as it was sent on 28-9-2023, the audit  could not be\nfinalized and the audit  report  could not be submitted on 29-9-2023.\n16. So far as the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents is that under  section  73 of the Act,\nshow  cause  notice  can be issued  independent of the provisions of Section  65, the same may be correct, but in\nthe present case, what we find from perusal of the show  cause  notice  under  section  73, is that there is a\nreference of the Audit  Report  dated 29-9-2023, and therefore, it cann ot be said that in the present case the\nshow  cause  notice  is indepe ndent of the audit  report . It is based on the audit  report , which in turn is not in\naccordance with the statutory provisions  but is in violation of the principles of natural justice as also the due\nprocedure of law .\n17. We accordingly  set aside  the impug ned show  cause  notice  under  section  73 of the Act as also the findings\nof the Audit  Officer vide report  dated 29-9-2023, and direct the respondent authorities/competent authorities,\nto pass fresh order/ report  on the audit , after taking into consideration the petitioner's reply dated 28-9-2023\nreceived on 3-10-2023 and consequent there upon to proceed further in accordance with law .\n18. It is however clarified that if the authorities intend to proceed under  section  73 of the Act, independent of\nany audit  under  section  65, in that case also they may proceed in accordance with law, but with due notice  of\nthe same to the petitioner .\n19.

Venkata Jyothirmai Pratapa, J. - The writ petition is filed under Articl e 226 of the Constitution of\nIndia seeking the following relief:\n\"to issue an appropriate W rit or Order or direction in the nature of W rit of Mandamus declaring the action\nof the 1st respondent in passing the impugned order of adjudication dated 13-4-2022 and rejection order\npassed by the 2nd respondent on 7-1-2023, rejecting the appeal at the admission stage, as illegal,\narbitrary , violation of principles of natural justice, contrary to the provisions of GST Act and Rules 2017,\nwithout jurisdiction authority and contra ry to the articles 14, 19 (1) (g), 21 and 265 of the Constitution of\nIndia and consequently to set aside the same and pass such other orders as deemed fit and proper under\nthe circumstances of the case\".\n2. The case of the petitioner in nut shell is that:Petitioner is a firm headed by a woman aged 72 years, engaged in works contra cts, by providing services\ni.e., running buses to VIT, Amaravathi and Ambulance Services. The petitioner also engaged in supply of\ngoods under GST Act, 2017. The registr ation of the firm earlier to the introduct ion of the GST Act, 2017\nwas under APVAT Act, 2005, CST Act, 1956 and Finance Act 1994 and was subsumed in GST Act,\n2017.\n(b) As authorized by the Joint Commissioner (ST), Chittor , the 1st respondent made a surprise visit on\n21-10-2020, to the petitioner's firm. Thereafter , the 1st respondent issued notices stating that certain\nturnover was escaped from tax and the same was treated as suppression of turn over for the Assessment\nperiod 07/2017 to 03/2020. Form No. DRC-01A was issued to pay the tax, penalty and interest as per\nsection  74 (5) of the GST Act, 2017, by the 1st respondent. As the petitioner has not filed any objections,\na show cause notices in Form DRC-01 was issued.\n(c) Petitioner has filed a reply stating that she could not furnish the details as the Covid was prevailing\nand explained the difficulties to submit  the details. Petitioner also expressed willingness to submit the\ninvoice within few days. Under the threat of arrest, a statement has been obtained from the petitioner\nundertaking to pay CGST and SGST . Petitioner requested the authority to grant 10 days time to submit\nall the details, because of Covid pande mic. A further show cause notice dated 2-3-2022 and personal\nhearing dated 10-3-2022 were sent to the petitioner . The 1st respondent finall y issued final notice and\npersonal hearing on 1 1-3-2022 to appear before the authority on 21-3-2022.\n(d) Petitioner though received notice, could not file reply . On 13-4-2022, the 1st respondent passed the\nimpugned order . The said order was received by Sri V. Dhanesh, who is accoun tant of the firm. The said\naccountant suffered  Covid pandemic for a period of six months and was on bed rest for one month.\nNeither the petitioner firm nor its partners knew about the impugned order passed by the 1st respondent\nas accountant  viz., Sri V . Dhanesh is absent for seven months.\n(e) Petitioner filed appeal before 2nd respondent with a delay of 81 days. The appeal came to be rejected\nby the 2nd respondent, since the appe al filed beyond the condonable period of limitation, which is\nimpugned in the present petition.\n(f) 1st respondent has issued a garnishee notice to the respondents Nos. 4 and 5, directing them to pay the\ndisputed amount of Rs. 6,20,05,487/-. The order impugned passed by 1st respondent shows the disputed\namount as Rs. 6,54,67,099/-. The amounts, which were paid by the petitioner , were not deducted either in\nthe adjudication order or in the garnishee notice.\n(g) Petitione r further stated that the matter may be remitted to 1st respondent,  giving opportunity to\npetitioner to file necessary material. She has no effective and efficacious alternative remedy , as per the\nAct, to address her grievance.\n3. Heard Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Assistant Government Pleader ,\nrepresenting the respondents for the Commercial T axes.\n4. As reques ted by learned counsel on behalf of both parties, the Writ Petition is being disposed of at the stage\nof admission.\n5. The chall enge in this Writ Petition is to the order passed by the 2nd respondent dated 7-1-2023, rejecting\nthe appeal filed by the petitioner challenging the assessment order dated 13-4-2022, passed by the 1st\nrespondent, at the stage of admission, on the ground that the appeal was filed beyond the condonable period of\nlimitation.\n6. Learned counsel for petitioner would submit that the Managing partner of the petitioner's firm is a woman\nof 72 years. Mr. V. Dhanesh, Accountant of the petitioner's firm received the assessment order dated 13-4-\n2022, passed by the 1st respondent. But as the accountant suffered from Covid for a period of seven months,\nhe could not attend the office. The partner of the petitioner's firm and other partners do not have any\nknowledge about the service of the adjudication order . The 2nd respondent summarily rejected the appeal on\nthe ground  that it is filed beyond the period of limitation. The disputed tax involved in this Case is Rs.\n6,54,67,099/-. Hence, he prays to  set aside the impugned order passed by the 2nd respondent.\n7. Per contra , the learned Government Pleader would submit that when the petitioner filed appeal beyond the\ncondonable period of limitation, the 2nd respondent has rightly rejected the appeal at the admission stage.\nThere are no grounds to  set aside the order impugned and prays to dismiss the petition.SHREY A8. The order impugned would demonstrate  that the authorized representative of the petitioner appeared before\nthe 2nd respondent for personal hearing and explained the reason for the delay occurred in approaching the\nAppellate Authority . At this juncture, it is appropriate to refer section  107 of the Act, which speaks about\nfiling of the Appeal.\n\"Number of days prescribed for filing of the appeal against the Assessment Order as per section  107 (1)\nof the Act is, three (03) months.\"\nOn perusal of the record, it is observed that the adjudicating authority passed impugned order on 13-4-2022.\nThe order was serve d on Mr. V. Dhanesh on the very same day. The petitioner ought to have filed the Appeal\nby 12-7-2022, but the petitioner filed the appeal on 1-1 1-2022, with a delay of 1 12 days.\n9. As per clause (4) of section  107 of the Act, the period of one month of delay in filing the appeal, can be\ncondoned, for any sufficient reasons. After deducting the period of one month, which is a condonable period\nas per the Act, still the delay of 81 days in preferring the appeal is visible from the record. Respondent No. 2\npassed order impugn ed, rejecting the appeal at the admission stage, on the point  that the appeal has been filed\nwith a delay beyond the condonable period of limitation.\n10. The medical certificate of Mr. V. Dhanesh is placed on record. No contrary material is filed, refuting the\ncontents of the medical certificate. Indee d, the right of appeal of a party is creat ure of statute and since, it is a\nstatutory remedy . The right of appeal under section  107 of the Act is also subject to certai n conditions. It is\nnot in dispute that, the 2nd respondent has no authority to admit the appeal , when it is filed beyond the\ncondonable period of one month of limitation as per the statute. The petitioner herein expressed her difficulty\nin filing the appeal within the time, since she has no knowledge about service of adjudication order on the\naccountant viz., Mr. Dhanesh.\n11. Needless to say that the High Court cannot exercise its' jurisdiction under section  226 of the Constitution\nof India, where a statutory appeal is filed beyond the condonable period of limitation as a matter of course.\nThe Hon'ble Apex Court while dealing  with the similar question under section  35 of AP VAT Act, 2005 in\nAsstt. Commissioner (CT) LTU v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. [2020] 116 taxmann.com\n417/36 G.S.T .L. 305 (SC) , held as under:\n\"When a Writ petition is filed challengin g the order of the authority dismissing the appeal on the ground\nthat it is preferred beyond the condonable period, the petitioner has to substantia te the plea of inability to\nfile appeal within prescribed period.\"\nLearned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to contest the\nmatter in appeal, against the original assessment order , by putting any condition to deposit same percentage of\ndisputed tax. No prudent man would keep quiet, without filing the appeal against the said order , since, the\ndisputed tax is huge amount in crores of rupees.\n12. Learned counsel for petitioner formidably urges that the petitioner is aged about 72 years and during the\nCovid pandemic, she could not pursue the matter , since the accountant is absent for a period of seven months.\n13. As the appeal against the order impugned passed by the 1st respondent is a statutory remedy , such right\ncannot be allowed to die. Since we are convinced with the inability pleaded by the petitioner , we considered it\napposite to dispose of this W rit Petition by imposing suitable conditions.\n14. In the result, this writ petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 7-1-2023 passed by the 2nd\nrespondent rejecting the appeal filed by the petitioner on the ground that the same was filed beyond the\ncondonable period is  set aside and conseq uently , the delay of 112 days in filing the appeal is condoned subject\nto the petitioner depositing 20% of the disputed tax in addition to the amount if any already deposited at the\ntime of filing the appeal and paying costs of Rs. 10,000/- with the High Court Legal Services Committee\nwithin six weeks from the date of receipt of copy of the order , upon which, the 2nd respondent shall admit the\nappeal filed by the petitioner and after affording an opportunity of hearing to both parties, dispose of the\nappeal in accordance with the governing law and rules expeditiously .\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The 1st petitioner is the owner of the goods and 2nd petitioner is the owner of the\nvehicle in the above writ petitions and they seek writ of mandamus declaring the action of 1st respondent in\ndetaining their goods and vehicles while  in transit with valid invoices as illegal  and consequently to set aside\nthe Form GST MOV -01, dated 12-6-2023 and confiscation notices in Form GST MOV -10, dated 14-6-2023\nproposing to confiscate the goods and vehicles and pass such other orders deemed fit.\n2. Petitioners' case succinctly is thus:\n(a) 1st petitioner who is common in the above batch of writ petitions is a trader in iron scrap under a\nvalid registered GST No. 37AA TCA9 148B1ZD. He purchased the iron scrap from the 4th\nrespondent under invoice, dated 12-6-2023 and in turn sold the same in favour of M/s Radha\nSmelters Private Limited, Sankarampe t, Medak District, Telangana State under valid invoice\nnumber . The 1st petitioner engaged the vehicles of the 2nd petitioner for trans porting goods from\nVijayawada to Sankarampet and consign ment was sent along with valid documents such as invoice,\nway bill, weighmen t slip etc., While goods were in transit the 1st respondent detained the vehicles\nalong with the goods on 12-6-2023 on the alleged ground that the vendor of the 1st petitioner i.e.,\nthe 4th respondent has no place of business at Vijayawada and accordingly issued impugned\nproceedings in the name of 4th respondent by deliberately ignoring the documents produced by the\ndrivers at the time of check.\n(b) It is further case of the petitioners that the 4th respondent having sold the scrap has no interest and\nin case of default on his part, the 1st respondent may initiate action against the 4th respondent.\nHowever , under the guise of initiating proceedings against the 4th respondent, the 1st respondent\ncannot put the petitioners in trouble as long as the transaction is covered by all relevant and\napplicable documents.\n(c) It is further case of the petitioners that the 1st respondent did not follow the procedure contemplated\nunder APGST/CGST  Act, 2017 and in straight away issued proceedings proposing to confiscate the\ngoods under transit without issuing notices in GST MOV -02, 03, 04, 05, 06 07, 08 or GST MOV\n-09 before issuing notice of confiscation in Form GST MOV -10. It is also contended that the\ndocuments served on the 2nd petitioner do not contain DIN Number . The 1st respondent has no\nright or jurisdiction to detain the goods and vehicle of the petitioners.\nHence, the writ petition.\n3. The 1st respondent filed counter mainly contending thus:\n(a) On 12-6-2023 the 1st respondent while conducting check of vehicles at Mahanadu Road, Auto\nNagar , Vijayawada found the lorries of the petitioners transporting iron scrap covered by Bill and\nE-way Bill, which on verification revealed that 4th respondent was transporti ng iron scrap from\nVijayawada destined  to be delivered to M/s Radha Smelters Pvt Ltd., Sankarampet, Medak District,\nTelangana State. It is noticed that 4th respondent without having any place of business in\nVijayawada dispatch ed goods therefrom. The consignment was not accompani ed by the purchase\nvoucher/invoice and payment of consid eration. Hence the proper officer record ed statement of the\ndrivers in Form GST 01. The Joint Commissioner (ST), Kurnool was requested to verify the\ngenesis of the goods and bonafide s of the seller dealer. Basing on the report of the Joint\nCommissioner (ST) Ku;rnool the registe ring authority suspended the registration of 4th respondent\non 13-6-2023. Since the goods are moved in violation of section 113 of APGST Act, notice of\nconfiscation in Form GST MOV -10 was issued proposing to confiscate the goods and conveyance.\nSubsequently two reminders were issue d to 4th respondent on 23-6-2023 and 3-7-2023. However ,\nthe seller remained silent. The transport is covered by bill and way bill issued by the 4th respondent\nand verific ation of the same shows that the 4th respondent sold iron scrap again st bill and way bill\nwithout any purcha se details. In the circumstances the vehicle and goods were detained by\nfollowing due process of law. Further , the Joint Commissioner (ST), Kurnool informed that theseller is a fake deale r who obtained regis tration by showing fictitious document and hence the same\nwas suspe nded. The Assistant Commissioner (ST), Kurnool-I, inspected the business premises of\nthe seller in Kurnool and recorded panchanama through mediators which show s that the seller is a\nnon-existing entity . In such a scenario, it is questionable as to how the buyer has purchased the\ngoods from a bogus and non-existing seller .\n(b) It is contended that the tax invoice and e-Way bill were raised by the 4th respo ndent implying that\nhe is the owner of the goods. The 1st petitioner failed to establish the owners hip of goods under\ndispute but submitted a letter dated 26-6-2023 without signature claiming owne rship of the goods.\nAs the letter is without signature, the 1st respondent issued an endorsement dated 30-6-2023 to the\naddress of the regist ered person which was returned with the endorsement as address is incomplete.\nThis creates a doubt about the existence of the 1st petitioner also. Since the notices in this case were\nissued through the GST portal by generating reference number and date, DIN need not be generated\nfor them.\n(c) It is also contended that since the petitioners failed to establish the owner ship of goods and\ngenuineness of the purchases allegedly made from the non-existing dealer , it is not obligatory on\nthe part of proper officer to issue notice to the petitioners. The writ petition is premature as the\nproceedings are pending and not attaine d finality . The respondent thus prayed  to dismiss the writ\npetition.\n4. The petitioners filed reply affidavit in W.P.No.15481/2023 and opposed the counter averments. It is\ncontended that the suspension of registr ation of 4th respondent on 13-6-2023 pending enquiry relating to its\ngenuineness, basing on the report of the Joint Commissioner (ST), Kurnool, is incorrect because the\ninspection of the premises of the 4th respondent according to Joint Commissioner's report was held only on\n01-7-2023 and that being so, the suspension of registration cannot precede to 13-6-2023. It is further\ncontended that at the time of interception of vehicle for check up, the 1st petitio ner is the owner of the goods-\ncum-seller and M/s. Radha Smelters Private Limited is the buyer and the transaction is covered by valid\ninvoice and waybill and those documents were accompanying the goods and therefore, if at all the 1st\nrespondent suspecte d the genuineness of the documents, he ought to have initiated proceedings against the 1st\npetitioner . The 1st respondent deliberate ly ignored the documents produced at the time of check which shows\nthe source of good s and issued proceedings in the name of 4th responden t. As per section 129 of the\nCGST/APGST Act, 2017, action if any can be initiated against the person who is transporting goods in\ncontravention of the provisions of the Act. In the instant case, the 1st petitioner is transporting goods with\nvalid documents. Instead of issuing proceedings in the name of petitioner , the 1st respondent issued notices\nagainst 4th respondent who has no interest in the matter after selling the consignment for valuable\nconsideration to the petitioner . Under law there is no requirement that the petitioner shall verify whether 4th\nrespondent has any registered place of business at Vijayawada. Having verified the credentials of GST\nregistration number of the 4th respondent on the Department web portal, the petitioner purchased the goods\nand paid the consideration through the bank transaction. However , the subsequent suspicion against the\ngenuineness of a registration of 4th respondent entertained by the Departm ent has no bearing with the\ntransaction entered into by the petitioner with 4th respondent. It is further contended that in view of deletion\nof non-obstante  clause in section 130 of the CGST Act, 2017, by virtue of the Finance Act, 2021, section 129\nof the GST Act will have overriding effect on section 130 of the said Act and thereby , in respect of goods in\ntransit, the procedure prescribed under section 129 of the CGST Act has to be followed. At any rate, since no\nnotice was issued in the name of the petitioners, the confiscation proposals against 4th respondent cannot be\nmade applicable against the petitioners.\n5. Heard Sri V. Siddharth Reddy , learn ed counsel for petitioners, and learne d Government Pleader for\nCommercial Taxes-1 representing the respondents. Both the learned counsel reiterated their pleadings in the\nrespective ar guments.\n6. Severely fulminating the action of the 1st respondent in issuing notice dated 12-6-2023 in Form GST MOV -\n01 and notice dated 14-6-2023 in Form GST MOV -10 U/s 130 of CGST/APGST Act proposing to confiscate\nthe goods and conve yance, learned counsel for petitioners would submit that the aforesaid notices were issued\nto 4th respondent on the main allegation s, as if, the consignor i.e., the 4th respondent has no place of business\nat Vijayawada but making movement of goods i.e., MS Scrap without any details of purchase and further , his\nregistration was suspended for obtaining the registration with fabricated documents. Learned counsel\nstrenuously argued that in fact the 1st petitioner has purchased the subject goods from the 4th respondent and\nsold to M/s Radha Smelters Private Limited and transporting through conveya nce of the 2nd petitioner andtherefore as on the date of interception i.e., 12-6-2023 the 1st petitioner was the owner of the goods but not\nthe 4th respondent. Driver of the goods produced all relevant documents before the 1st respondent but he\nselectively perused only the invoice issued by the 4th respondent and came to conclusion as if the details of\nthe Vendor of the 4th respondent and concerned bills were not produced and detained the vehicle. Learned\ncounsel would lament that if the 1st respondent had any suspicion about the genuineness of the business of the\n1st petitio ner and his GST registration, he ought to have issued notice U/s 129 of CST/APGST Act and\ninitiated proceedings. Without doing so he straight away issued notice of confiscation against the 4th\nrespondent while detaining the goods pertaining to the 1st petitioner which is illegal and unjust. He further\nargued that without initiating proceedings U/s 129 against the petitioners, resorting to Section 130 of the Act\nagainst 4th responde nt and on that ground proposing to confiscate the goods of the 1st petitioner is illegal. He\nplaced reliance on the order dated 16-8-2022 in W.P.No.100849/2022 (T.Res) Rajeev Traders  v. Union of\nIndia [2022] 142 taxmann.com 420 (Kar.)/2022 (66) G.S.T .L. 15 (Kar.)/[2023] 95 GST 313 (Kar.) passed by\nlearned single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka, Dharwad Bench.\n7. In oppugnation learned Government Pleader would argue, the vehicles were intercepted at Auto Nagar ,\nVijayawada on 12-6-2023 by the 1st respondent and having found they contained iron scrap, he enquired the\ndrivers who produce d the invoices dated 12-6-2023 which showed that the consignment was destined from\nVijayawada to Sankarampet, Medak, Telangana. The invoices further showed that M/s K.S Enterprises, i.e.,\nthe 4th respondent is the owner of the consignment and the 1st petitioner is the buyer and the consignee is\nM./s Radh a Smelters Pvt Ltd. Learned G.P would weightily point out that since the 4th respondent has no\nplace of business at Vijayawada wheref rom the goods were sought to be transp orted and as the driver at that\ntime could not show  the bill of purchase, the mode of payment of purchase price by 1st petitioner to 4th\nrespondent and mode of transportatio n from Kurnool to Vijayawada, the 1st respondent suspected the\nbonafide s of 4th respondent and detained the vehicles and informed the Joint Commissioner (ST) Kurnool to\nexamine  bonafide s of seller i.e., the 4th respondent. The enquiry revea led that the 4th respondent was not\ndoing business in the given address at Kurnool and there was no such person. Therefore, the GST registration\nof the 4th respondent was suspended on 13-6-2023 pending further enquiry and notice of confiscation in Form\nGST MOV -10 was issued U/s 130 of CGST/APGST Act, 2017 to 4th respondent.\n8. Refuting the argument of the petitioners that no notice was issued and actio n was initiated against the\npetitioners but their stock and vehicle  were illegally detained by initiating  proceedings against the 4th\nrespondent, learned G.P would submit that since the origin of the goods as per the invoice is relatable to 4th\nrespondent who happens to be a fictitious person, proceedings were initiated against him by issuing notices.\nThe 4th respondent shall appear and prove the authenticity of his business. Be that as it may, since the 1st\npetitioner claims to be the purchaser from the 4th respondent, though proceedings were not separately\nlaunched against him, he owes a responsibility to establish the authenticity of the transaction between him and\nthe 4th respondent by producing invoice and purchase bill issued by the 4th respondent and also the mode of\npayment of conside ration to him and further , produce relevant document as to the place of purchase of the\ngoods i.e., Kurnool or Vijayawada or some other place and mode of transportation to Vijayawada if delivery\nwas obtained at some other place. Learned G.P would thus argue that the burde n of proving the genuineness\nof the transaction between the 1st petitioner and the 4th respondent lay on the former . He would submit that\nthe petitioners can attend the enquiry and establish their innocence by producing the relevant documents.\nLearned GP defended the action of the 1st respondent in straight away initiating proceedings U/s 130 of\nCGST/APGST Act on the submission  that the very existence of 4th respondent and his obtaining GST\nregistration were doubtful.\n9. The point for consideration is:\n(1) Whether 1st respondent is legally justified in detaining the goods and vehicles of petitioners\nwithout initiating any proceedings against them but only against the 4th respondent U/s 130 of\nCGST/APGST Act, 2017 ?\n10. POIN T: The authority of a proper officer to inspect the goods in movement can be traceable to Section 68\nof CGST/APGST Act, 2017 which reads thus:\n\"68. Inspection of goods in movement:\n(1) The Government may require the person in charge of a conveyance carrying any\nconsignment of goods of value exceedi ng such amount as may be specified to carry with\nhim such documents and such devices as may be prescribed.(3) The details of docum ents required to be carried under sub-section (1) shall be validated in\nsuch manner as may be prescribed.\n(3) Where any conveyance referred to in sub-section (1) is intercepted by the prope r officer at\nany place,  he may require the person in charge of the said conveyance to produce the\ndocuments prescribe d under the said sub-section and devices for verification, and the said\nperson shall be liable to produce the documents and devices and also allow the inspection\nof goods.\"\n11. Then , the details of documents required to be carried under sub-section (1) are narrated in rule 138A of\nCGST/APGST Rule s, 2017, as per which the following documents and devices to be carried by a person in\ncharge of a conveyance:\ni. The invoice or bill of supply or delivery challan, as the case may be; and\nii. A copy of the e-way bill in physical form or the e-way bill number in electronic  form or mapped to\na Radio Frequency Identification Device embedded on to the conveyance in such manner as may be\nnotified by the Chief Commissioner:\n Provided that nothing contained in clause (b) of this sub-rule shall apply in case of movement of\ngoods by rail or by air or vessel.\n Provided further that in case of imported goods, the person in charge of a conveyance shall also\ncarry a copy of the bill of entry filed by the importer of such goods and shall indicate the number\nand date of the bill of entry in Part A of FORM GST EWB-01\n** ** **\n12. Authorized by above provisions, in the instant case the proper of ficer/1st respondent intercepted the lorries\nat Auto Nagar , Vijayawada, on 12-6-2023 which were found carrying iron scrap covered by bill and e-way\nbills. They revealed that the consignor i.e., the 4th respondent without having place of business at V ijayawada,\ntransporting the goods from Vijayawada to Sankarampet, Medak in Telang ana State. According to 1st\nrespondent, the enquiry conducted by Joint Commissioner (ST), Kurnool, revealed the 4th respondent was not\ndoing business in the given address at Kurnool and there was no such person and therefore, his GST\nregistration was suspended w .e.f. 13-6-2023 and enquiry was initiated against 4th respondent by issuing notice\nof confiscation in Form GST MOV -10 under section 130 of the CGST/APGST Act, 2017. The contention of\nthe Revenue is that since the existence and business activities of the 4th respondent are highly doubtful,\nconfiscation procee dings U/s 130 of the CGST/APGST Act, 2017 can be launched directly against 4th\nrespondent without reference to the petitioners and as the 1st petitioner claims to be the purchaser from 4th\nrespondent, he has to establish that he is a bonafide  purchaser from 4th respondent for valuable consideration\nby paying the due tax without knowing the credentials of 4th respondent by participating in the enquiry\nproceedings initiated against the 4th respondent.\nPer contra, the contention of 1st petitioner is that he is the bonafide  purchase r from 4th respondent for\nvaluable consideration on verifying GST registration of the 4th respondent on the web portal and sold the\ngoods to M/s. Radha Smelters Private Limited, Medak in Telangana and was transporting the goods from\nVijayawada to the consignee through the conveyance of 2nd respondent backed by invoice and e-way bill etc.\nand in spite of producing the relevant records by the driver , the 1st responde nt did not consider them and\nissued confiscation proceedings against 4th respondent, the original seller . Their  prime contention is that since\nthe interce ption was made while the goods were in transit, if at all any doubt is entertained against the\nbonafide s of the petitioners, the 1st respondent shall issue notice u/s 129 of the CGST/APGST Act against the\npetitioners and proceed accordingly , but the Revenue cannot impose the proceedings initiated against 4th\nrespondent on the petitioners.\n13. In the light of the above respective contentions, the bone of contention in this case is whether the Revenue\ncan confiscate the goods of the petitioners basing on the proceedings initiated against the 4th respondent.\n14. In Rajeev Traders'  case (supra ) High Court of Karnataka, (Dharwad Bench) a learned single Judge has\ndrawn the distinction between section 129 and 130 of CGST Act as follows:\n\"103. It is to be stated that the power to detain under section 129 cannot be converted to a proceeding\nunder section 130 of the Act since both these provisions operate independently of each other and inSBcompletely different contexts. The power to detain is only to stop the transit of the goods and thereby\nprevent its movemen t till the tax and penalty is paid. However , the power to confiscate is the process of\ndivesting the owner of the goods of all title to the goods for a contravention of the provisions of the Act\nand Rules. The intent behind conferring power to detain the goods under section 129 is fundamentally to\nensure that the applicable tax and penalty is recovered whereas the intent behind confiscation under\nSection 130 is to divest the owner of the goods itself and also impose liability of payment of the\napplicable tax and penalty .\"\n15. In Syner gy Fertichem Pvt Ltd. v. State of Gujarat 2020(33) G.S.T .L 513 (Guj.) =\nMANU/GJ/3200/2019/[2019] 112 taxmann.com 370 (Guj.)  a division bench of Gujarath High Court also\nexplained the distinction between section 129 and 130 CGST Act as follows:\n\"(i) Section 129 of the Act talks about detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyances in transit.\nOn the other hand, section 130 talks about confiscation of goods or conveyance  and levy of tax, penalty\nand fine thereof. Although, both the sections start with a non-obstante  clause, yet, the harmonious\nreading of the two sections, keeping in mind the object and purpose behind the enactment thereof, would\nindicate that they are independent of each other . Section 130 of the Act, which provides for confiscation\nof the goods or conveyance is not, in any manner , dependent or subject to section 129 of the Act. Both\nthe sections are mutually exclusive.\"\n16. Thus  as can be seen from the two provisions and their narration given in the above two decisions, it is\nclear that the proceedings for detent ion of goods can be initiated while the goods are in transit in\ncontravention of provisions of the CGST/APGST Act. In the instant case also the 1st respondent has detained\nthe goods of the 1st petitioner while they were in transit from Vijayawada to Sankarampet, Medak, Telangana\nState. That being the factual scenario, the question is whether 1st respondent can confiscate the goods of the\n1st petitioner without initiating any proceedings against him u/s 129 but initiating proceedings u/s 130 of\nCGST/APGST Act against the 4th respondent on the ground of dubious credentials of the 4th respondent. In\nour considered view though the 1st respondent may initiate proceedings against the 4th respondent u/s 130 of\nthe Act in view of his absence in the given address and not holding any business premises at Vijayawada,\nhowever , he cannot confiscate the goods of the 1st petitioner merely on the ground that the 1st petitioner\nhappen to purchase goods from the 4th respondent. Even assuming that the petitioners, particularly the 1st\npetitioner partakes in the enquiry procee dings against the 4th respondent, his responsibility will be limited to\nthe extent of estab lishing that he bonafide ly purchased goods from the 4th respondent for valuable\nconsideration by verifying the GST registration of the 4th respondent available on the official web portal and\nhe was not aware of the credentials of the 4th respondent. Further , he has to establish the mode of payment of\nconsideration and the mode of receiving  of goods from the 4th respondent through authenticated documents.\nExcept that he cannot be expected to speak about the business activities of the 4th respondent and also\nwhether he obtained GST registration by producing fake documents. In essence, the petitioners have to\nestablish their own credentials but not the 4th respondent. In that view , the 1st respondent is not correct in\nroping the petitioners in the proceeding s initiated against the 4th respondent without initiating independent\nproceedings u/s 129 of CGST/APGST Act against the petitioners. As the 1st petitioner claims to have\npurchased goods from the 4th respondent whose physical existence in the given address is highly doubtful as\nper the enquiry conducted by the Joint Commissioner (ST), Kurnool, the 1st petitioner as observed  supra ,\nowes a responsibili ty to prove the genuineness of the transactions between him and the 4th respondent.\nTherefore, the 1st respondent can initiate proceedings u/s 129 of CGST/APGST Act against the petitioners\nand conduct enquiry by giving opportunity to the petitioners to establish their case.\n17. These writ petitions are accordingly disposed of giving liberty to the 1st respondent to initiate proceedings\nagainst the petitione rs u/s 129 of CGST/APGST Act, 2017 within two weeks from the date of receipt of a\ncopy of this order and conduct enquiry by giving an opportunity of hearin g to the petitioners and pass\nappropriate orders in accordance with governing law and rules. In the meanwhile, the 1st respondent shall\nrelease the detained goods in favour of 1st petitioner on his deposit of 25% of their value and executing\npersonal bond for the balance and he shall also release the vehicles in favour of the 2nd petitioner in the\nrespective writ petitions on their executing personal security bonds for the value of the vehicles as determined\nby concerned Road T ransport Authority . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

The present Writ Petition came to be filed under article 226 of the Consti tution of India seeking the\nfollowing relief :\u2014\n\"\u2026\u2026 to issue an appropriate Writ, Order or Direction more particularly one in the nature of \"Writ of\nMandamus\" declaring the action of the Respondents in demanding Central GST and AP GST of 9% each,\ntotaling 18% on the monthly license fee collected from the Petitioner for the work contract of\nmaintenance of toilets at 4th Responden t Bus Station, as illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the exemption\ngranted by the Gove rnment of India, Ministry of Finance through its Notification No. 12/2017- Central\nTax (Rate), Dt.28-6-2017, and G.O. Ms. No. 588 dated 12-12-2017, issued by Revenue (Commercial\nTaxes-II) Department, Government of A.P., contrary to the order passed by this Hon'ble Court in W.P.\nNo. 3197 of 2019 and to pass \u2026\u2026\"ANURAG3. The averments made in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition disclose that the petitioner was\nawarded contracts of cleaning toilets in different bus stations under respondent No. 2. The petitioner is\npunctual in paying rents including 18% G.S.T . i.e., 9% Centr al G.S.T . and 9% A.P. State G.S.T ., as demanded\nby the respondents. While things stood thus, the Government of India, Minist ry of Finance (Department of\nRevenue), through its Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6- 2017, exempted G.S.T . for the\nservice under Heading 9994, serial No. 76, which refers to \"Services by way of public conveniences such as\nprovision of facilities of bathroom, washrooms, lavatories, urinal or toilets.\" Similar exemption was granted\nby the State of Andhra Pradesh through G.O. Ms. No. 588, Revenue (Comm ercial Taxes-II) Department,\ndated 12-12-2017. Since the demand notice issued on 10-6-2022 refers to demand of G.S.T . in spite of the\nnotifications issued above, the present writ petition came to be filed.\n4. No counters are filed in spite of taking time.\n5. The short point that arises for consideration is:\n\"Whether the authorities were right in demanding G.S.T . on the monthly license fee paid by the\npetitioner?\"\nPOINT :\u2014\n6. Sri Sreekanth Reddy Ambati, learned counsel for the petitioner , mainly submits that in view of Notification\nNo. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017, issued by the Government of India and G.O. Ms. No. 588,\ndated 12-12-2017, issued by the Govern ment of Andhra Pradesh, the petitioner is exempted from payment of\nG.S.T .\n7. The same is strongl y opposed by Sri S.A.V . Sai Kumar , learned Assistant Gove rnment Pleader representing\nSri Y.N. Vivekanan da, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax appearing for respondent No. 5,\nstating that the notifications relied upon by the petitioner do not apply to the case on hand.\n8. As stated earlier , no counter is filed opposing the same.\n9. A perusal of the Notification, dated 28-6-2017, (Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate), would show\nthat Heading 9994 relates to \"Services by way of public conveniences such as provision of facilities of\nbathroom, washroom s, lavatories, urinal or toilets\" and the rate of tax against the said heading is shown as\n\"nil\". Simi larly, the Government of Andhra Pradesh,  vide G.O. Ms. No. 588, dated 12-12-2017, issued similar\nnotification exempting payment of tax for the services rendered by such Agency .\n10. As these two notifications are still in force and no notification is issued modify ing or overriding the same,\nwe feel that the writ petition deserves to be allowed.\n11. Accordin gly, this Writ Petition is allowed, declaring the action of the responde nts in demanding C.G.S.T .\nand A.P .G.S.T . at the rate of 9% each on the monthly license fee paid by the petitioner for the work contract of\nmaintenance of toilets at respondent No. 4 bus station as illegal and improper .

Srinivasa Raw , Counsel for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J.  - In the instant writ petition, the petition er challenges the AJC order No. 4959/29-1-\n2020 dated 11-12-2019 served on 22-2-2020 passed by the 3rd respondent rejecting the appeal filed by the\npetitioner against the assessment order dated 30-5-2018 passed by the 4th respondent.\n2. The petitioner deals in edible and non-edible oils and it is a registered dealer under the APGST Act, 2017.\n(a) The 4th respondent  consequent to the inspection of petitioner's business prem ises on 3-2-2018,\nissued a show cause notice in Form GST DRC-02 (APGST) on 22-3-201 8 in respect of a\ndifferential turnove r involving a tax liability of Rs. 1,72,920/-. The petitioner submitted its\nexplanation. However , the 4th respondent passed assessment order dated 30-5-2018 fixing tax\nliability of Rs. 1,72,920/-on the differential turnover of Rs. 69,16,797/- for the tax period July 2017to February 2018. The 4th respondent passed a separate assessment order for equal sum of tax\nunder the provisions of the CGST Act, 2017.\n(b) Aggrieved by the two assessment orders under CGST Act, 2017 and APGST Act, 2017, the\npetitioner filed appeals in the office of the 3rd respondent on 28-6-2018 along with proof of\npayment of pre-deposit @ 10% of the disputed tax which was received by the office of the 3rd\nrespondent on 28-6-2018.\n(c) As per Section 107 of the CGST Act, appeal has to be preferred within three months from the date\non which the assessment order is communicated. In the instant case, the assessment order was\npassed by the 4th respondent on 30-5-2018 which was received by the petition er on 5-6-2018 and\nthe appeals were filed on 28-6-2018 within time.\n(d) The orders dated 30-5-2018 under the provisions of the APGST Act, 2017 and the CGST Act, 2017\nwere not uploaded by the 4th respondent on GST common portal. Since there is no stipulation in\nthe appeal provision that the appeal has to be invariably filed online on GST portal, the petitioner\nfiled appeal papers in the office of the 3rd respondent in person and obtained acknowledgment from\nthe of fice of the 2nd respondent.\n(e) Later , in response to the check memo, issued on 4-9-2019, the petitioner gave reply on 17-9-2019.\nThe substance of the check memo was that the appeal was not filed on GST portal and in reply , the\npetitioner submitted  that the proceedings of assessment under both the Acts were served on the\npetitioner manually on 5-6-2018 but not by uploading through online and as the efforts made by the\npetitioner to file appeal before the appellate Authority through online were not successful as the\nGST common portal failed to open, the petitioner had to file the appeal manually . However , the\nappeal was rejected on the sole ground  that the same was not filed electronic ally vide impugned\norder dated 1 1-12-2019.\n(f) The 3rd respondent has no authority to reject the appeal. The petitioner complie d with the statutory\ncondition of pre-deposit @ 10% of the disputed tax. The impugned order was served on the\npetitioner on 22-2-2020. As against the impugned appeal rejection order , an appeal ought to have\nbeen prese nted on or before 21-5-2020  before the Appellate Tribunal. Since there is no appellate\ntribunal constituted, the question of applicability of any limitation period does not arise. Further , the\nwife of the petitioner succumbed to corona and therefore, the petitioner filed the writ petition.\n3. Learned Government Pleader filed counter on behalf of the 3rd respondent and opposed the writ petition.\n4. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner , Sri B. Sriniva sa Rao, and learned Government Pleader\nrepresenting learned Additional Advocate General-II appearing for the respondents.\n5. The Counsel for the petitioner submits that since the Assessment Order copies were received manually ,\nthere was no occasio n for the petitioner  to submit grounds of appeal electronically as he has to file the order\ncopies and other relevant documents along with the grounds of appeal. Further , Rule 108 of APGST Rules,\n2017 gives liberty to an appellant to file an appeal with required forms and relevant documents \"either\nelectronically or otherwise as notified by the Chief Commissioner\". Since the Chief Commissioner has, as of\nnow, not notified any particular form for filing appeal, the appellant is at liberty  to file the appeal by choosing\neither mode. He further argued that in fact the petitioner tried to upload the appeal electronically through the\nGST porta l, but as the portal did not open, he had resorted to manual mode and the same was accepted by the\noffice of the 3rd respondent  vide acknowledgment dated 28-6-2018. In spite of the same, he lamented, the\nappeal was rejected on the sole ground that it was not filed electronically . He relied upon the judgment in\nW.P.No.3308 of 2021 dated 11-2-2021 of a Division Bench of this Court to contend that in similar\ncircumstances, this Court directed the respondent Department to receive the appeal manually and pass\nappropriate orders.\n6. Per contra, learned Government Pleader  contended that as per Rule 108 of the GST Rules, an appeal should\ninvariably be filed electronically but not by other mode. On two propositions, he sought to buttress his\nargument.\n7. Firstly , referring to Rule 108(1), he argued that the phraseology \"either electronically or otherwise as may\nbe notified by the Chief Commissioner\" should be comprehended in such a manner that electronic mode of\nfiling is mandatory , since the word \"shall\" is employed some words prior to the word \"electronically\". Then,\nthe remaining part i.e., \"otherwis e as may be notified by the Chief Commissioner\" should be understood thatthe other mode of filing including manual filing is permissible, if it is so notifie d by the Chief Commissioner .\nSince such notification is not given, it should be understood that appeal should be filed only electronically .\n8. To appreciate the above ar gument it is apposite to reproduce Rule 108 which reads thus:\nAppeal to the Appellate Authority\n(1) An appeal to the Appellate Authority under sub-section (1) of section 107 shall be filed in FORM\nGST APL-01, along with the relevant documents, either electronically or otherwise as may be\nnotified by the Chief Commissioner , and a provisional acknowledgment shall be issued to the\nappellant immediately .\n(2) The grounds of appeal and the form of verification as contained in FORM GST APL-01 shall be\nsigned in the manner specified in rule 26.\n(3) A certified copy of the decision or order appealed against shall be submitted within seven days of\nfiling the appeal under sub-rule (1) and a final acknowledgment, indicating appeal number shall be\nissued thereafter in FORM GST APL-02  by the Appellate Authority or an officer authroised by him\nin this behalf:\nProvided  that where the certified copy of the decision or order is submitted within seven days from the date\nof filing the FORM  GSTAPL-01, the date of filing of the appeal shall be the date of the issue of the\nprovisional acknowledgment and where  the said copy is submitted after seven days, the date of filing of the\nappeal shall be the date of the submission of such copy .\n9. The word s \"electron ically\" and \"otherwise\" are co-related with the two conjunc tions i.e., \"either\" and \"or\".\nGrammatically , these two conjunctions are used in co-relation with some words to indicate the alternativity or\nchoice between the two persons, things, or events. In the instant case, the word \"electronically\" is prefixed\nwith the conjunction \"either\" and the word \"otherwise\" is prefixed with the conjunction \"or\". From this usage,\nwhat can be deduced  is that the mode of filing is a choice between electronic and other form (usually , manual\nform), as may be notified by the Chief Commissioner . Since admittedly notification is yet to be given by the\nChief Commissione r, appeal can be filed in either manner . The mandate of the word \"shall\" in Rule 108(1)\napplies to Form GST APL-01 but not to the word \"electronically\". In my view, if the word \"shall\" was\nintended to govern the word \"electronica lly\" also, the word \"either\" would not have been posited immediately\nbefore the word \"electronically\" becau se the phrases \"shall electronically\" and \"either electronically\" are\noxymorons. In W .P.No.3308 of 2021, a Division Bench of this Court expressed similar view as follows:\n\"10. As can be seen from Rule 108(1) of APGST Rules, 2017, the language employed therein is as clear as\ncrystal to the effect that an appeal to the appellate authority under section 107(1) of the APGST Act shall be\nfiled along with form GST APL-01 and the relevant documents 'either electronically or otherwise as may be\nnotified by the Chief Commissioner'. So, till the Chief Commissioner specified one particular mode of filing,\nthe concerned appellant can choose to file the appeal either electronically or otherwise i.e., manually . In that\nview , the interpretation of the 1st respondent that since the Chief Commissioner has not given notification that\nthe manual filing of the appeal can be accepted by the appellate authority , the appellant cannot file the appeal\nin manual form is contrary to the purport of Rule 108(1) of APGST Rules, 2017.\"\nSo, the first ar gument of learned Government Pleader cannot be countenanced.\n10. Secondly , referring to rule 108(2) and Rule 26 of the APGST Rules, learned Government Pleader argued\nthat the grounds of appeal and the form of verification as contained in FORM GST APL-01 shall be signed as\nspecified in rule 26. Whereas rule 26 specifies the method of authenticati on of applications and other\ndocuments including  \"appeals\" saying that the documents including appeals shall be submitted electronically\nwith a digital signat ure certificate or through e-signature as specified under the provisions of Information and\nTechnology Act, 2000 or verified by any other mode of signature or verification as notified by the Chief\nCommissioner in that behalf. Learned Government Pleader thus argued that since Rule 26 specifies that\nappeals and other documents shall be submitted electronically with a digital signature certificate or e-\nsignature, it should be understood that appeal under Rule 108 shall be filed only electronically .\n11. Rule 26(1) reads thus:\nMethod of authenticationS.K. JAIN(1) All applications, including reply , if any, to the notices, returns including the details of outward and\ninward supplies, appeals or any other document required to be submitted under the provisions of these\nrules shall be so submitted electronica lly with digital signature certificate or through e-signature as\nspecified under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (Act No. 21 of 2000) or verified\nby any other mode of signature or verification as notified by the Chief Commissioner in this behalf:\nProvided that  a register ed person registered under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (Act No.\n18 of 2013) shall furnish the documents or application verified through digital signature certificate.\"\nIt is true that rule 26(1) specifies that all applications including the appeals which are required to be\nsubmitted under the provisions of these Rules shall be so submitted electronical ly with a digital signature\ncertificate or through e-signature or verified by any other mode of signature or verification as notified by\nthe Chief Commissioner . So far as verif ication is concerned, Notification No. 6/2017-Central Tax dated\n19-6-2017 was issued by the G.O.I. Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Central Board of\nExcise and Customs, stating that the mode of verification for the purpose of Rule 26(1) is (i) Aadhar\nbased electronic verification code (EVC) and (ii) Bank account based one time password (OTP). Thus\napparently there is a discrepancy betwe en Rule 108(1) and (2) with regard to the manner of filing the\nappeal and other documents. In view of the discrepancy , the benefit must go to the subject as it is a tax\nlaw.\n12. Accordingly , this Writ Petition is allow ed setting aside the impugned order No. 4959/29-1-2020 dated 11-\n12-2019 passed by the 3rd respondent with a direction that the 3rd respondent shall receive the appeal,\nprocess the same and if there are any defects, issue suitable check memos for compliance by the petitioner , in\nwhich case, the petitioner shall comply the same within the time prescribed and resubmit the appeal either\nelectronically or manually whereupon the 3rd respondent shall consider the appeal and after hearing the\npetitioner , pass appropriate order in accordance with the governing law and rules. There shall be no order as to\ncosts.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any , pending for consideration shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order dated 5-6-2023 is not signed by the\nauthority and consequently , no order in the eyes of law. The same cannot be implemented or given effect to.\nHe submits that the matter is squarel y covered by the order passed by this Court in the case of SRK\nEnterprises  v.

Learned Governme nt Pleader for Commercial Tax has obtained oral instructions from the authority and\ninformed that the impugned order is not signed but was uploaded by the competent authority . He raised the\nsame plea as was raised in SRK Enterprises'  case (cited  supra ) relying on sections 160 and 169 of the Central\nGoods and Services T ax Act, 2017 (for short 'the CGST Act, 2017').\n5. In SRK Enterprises'  case (cited  supra ), this Court referred  to the previous order of the Co-ordinate Bench in\nthe case of A.V.Bhanoji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) [W.P. No. 2830 of 2023, dated 14-2-2023] in\n[W.P.No.2830 of 2023 dated 14-2-202 3] and held that the signatures cannot be dispensed with and the\nprovisions of sections 160 & 169 of the CGST Act, 2017 would not come to the rescue. This Court held that:\n\"7. On consideration of the submissions advanced and the legal provisions, we are of the view that\nsection 160 of CGST Act 2017 is not attracted. An unsigned  order cannot be covered under \"any mistake,\ndefect or omission therein\" as used in section 160. The said expression refers to any mistake, defect or\nomission in an order with respect to assessment, re-assessment; adjudication etc and which shall not be\ninvalid or deemed to be invalid by such reason, if in substance and effect the assessment, re-assessment\netc is in conformity with the requirements of the Act or any existing law . These would not cover omission\nto sign the order . Unsigned  order is no order in the eyes of law. Merely uploading of the unsigned  order ,\nmay be by the Authority competent to pass the order , would, in our view , not cure the defect which goes\nto the very root of the matter i.e. validity of the order .\n8. We are of the further view that section  169 of CGST Act 201 7 is also not attracted. Here, the question\nis of not signing the order and not of its service or mode of service.\n9. In the case of A. V. Bhanoji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) in W.P.No.2830 of 2023 decided on\n14-2-2023, upon which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the petitioner (Ex.P6), a Co-\nordinate Bench of this Court has held that the signatures cannot be dispensed with and the provisions of\nsections 160 and 169 of CGST Act would not come to the rescue.\n10. Paragraph 6 of A. V. Bhanoji Row  (supra ) is reproduced as under:-\n\"6. A reading of section 160 of the Act makes it very much clear and candid that the safeguards contained\ntherein cannot be made applicable for the contingency in the present case. Section 169 of the Act, which\ndeals with the service of notice, enables  the department to make available any decision, order , Summons,\nNotice or other communication in the common portal. In the guise of the same, the signatures cannot be\ndispensed with. In the considered opinio n of this court, the aforesaid provisions of law would not come to\nthe rescue of the respondent herein, for justifying the impugned action.\"\n6. In view of the aforesaid, we allow this petition and set aside the proceedings /order issued by respondent\nNo. l dated 5-6-2023.

Heard learned counsel for petitioner Sri Suri Babu and Sri P.Shreyas Reddy , learned Government Pleader\nCommercial Tax representing responden ts 1 to 3, Sri Suresh Kumar Routhu, learned Senior Standing Counsel\nfor CBIC representing respondent 4 and Sri N.Harinath, learned Deputy Solicitor General for respondent 5.\n3. After making preliminary arguments, learned counsel for petitioner referring to the order dated 14-9-2022\nin W.P.No.17267 of 2022 passed by a Division Bench of this High Court, would submit that the said order\nsquarely applies to the case on hand and requested to pass the order accordingly .4. In W.P.No.17267 of 2022 a Division Bench of this High Court was dealing with the question whether the\nauthorities were right in charging GST in respect of mango pulp at the rate of 18%.Answering the aforesaid\nquestion, the Division Bench of this High Court passed the following order:\n\"6. Referring to the order passed by the Appellate Authority , learned counsel for the petitioner would submit\nthat pendi ng the writ petition, the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue (Tax\nResearch Unit), issued a Circular dated 3-8-2022 wherein while referring to Mangoes under CTH 0804, stated\nas under:\n\"4. Mangoes under CTH 0804 includin g mango pulp, but other than fresh mangoes and sliced, dried\nmangoes, attract GST at 12% rate:\n4.1 Representations  have been receive d seeking clarification regarding the applicable GST rate on\ndifferent forms of Mangoes including Mango Pulp.\n4.2 On the basis of the recommendation of the GST Council in its 22 Meeting, the GST rate on Mangoes\nsliced, dried, falling under heading 0804, was reduced from 12% to 5% [S.No.30A of Schedule I of\nnotification No. 1/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated the 28th June, 2017]. However , the GST rate on all\nforms of dried mangoes (other than sliced and dried mangoes), falling under heading 0804, including\nmango pulp, was always meant to be at the rate of 12%.\n4.3 Accordingly , it is hereby clarified that mangoes, fresh falling under heading 0804 are chargeable to a\nconcessional rate of 5%; while all other  forms of dried mango, including Mango pulp, attract GST at the\nrate of 12%. To bring absolute clarity , the relevant entry at S.No.16 of Schedule-II of notification No.\n1/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28th June, 2017, has been amended  vide notification No. 6/2022-\nCentral T ax (Rate), dated the 13th July , 2022.\n4.4 Fresh mangoes, falling under heading 0804, continue to remain exempt from GST (S.No.51 of\nnotification No. 2/2017-Central T ax (Rate), dated 28th June, 2017] .\"\n7. From a reading of the above, it is very clear now that on the basis of recommendation of GST Council\nin its 22nd meeting, the GST rate on \u201eMangoes sliced, dried? falling under heading 0804 was reduced\nfrom 12% to 5% while GST rate on all forms of dried mangoes (other than sliced and dried mangoes)\nfalling under heading 0804, including mango pulp, was always meant to be at the rate of 12%. Therefore,\nthe petitioner is liable to pay GST on Mango pulp @12%.\n8. In view of the above, orders passed by the Appellate Authority for Advance  Ruling imposing GST in\nrespect of \u201emango pulp? @18% is incorrect and it is made clear that the petition er is liable to pay GST in\nrespect of Mango pulp @12%.\"\n5. Learned Governmen t Pleader while admitting the above ruling being applicable to the case on hand, and\nalso further admitting that to his knowledge no appeal is filed against the said order , however would submit\nthat the Circular issued by the Govern ment of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue (Tax\nResearch Unit), applies prospectively i.e., from 3-8-2022 and as the tax period in the instant case is being\n2017-18 to 2020-21, the said Circular will not operate retrospectively and therefore, the petitioner cannot\nclaim any advantage on the strength of aforesaid Circular . Thus, though the learned Government Pleader\nadmitted that the order in the W.P.No.17267 of 2022 has some bearing with the case on hand, however , the\nsame cannot be relied upon by the petitioner , since the Circular dated 3-8-2022 has only prospective\napplication, but not retrospectively .\n6. We are unable to accept the above contention of the learned Government Pleader . The Circular which was\nreproduced above, contains a mentioni ng at Para 4.2 as follows which is being extracted for convenience\nsake:\n\"4.2 On the basis of the recommendation of the GST Council in its 22 Meeting, the GST rate on Mangoes\nsliced, dried, falling under heading 0804, was reduced from 12% to 5% [S.No.30A of Schedule I of\nnotification No. 1/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated the 28th June, 2017]. However , the GST rate on all\nforms of dried mangoes (other than sliced and dried mangoes), falling under heading 0804, including\nmango pulp, was always meant to be at the rate of 12%.\"\n7. Thus, in the above Circular , it was pellucidly mentioned that \"including mango pulp was always meant to\nbe at the rate of 12%\". Considering such mentioning, the Division Bench of this High Court, which was also\ndealing with the case falling prior to the date of Circular , held that the petitioner therein was liable to pay GSTSBon mango pulp at the rate 12% only and passed the order accordingly . It would show , a Division Bench of this\nHigh Cour t has ultimately held that since the Circular reads to the effect that the GST rate including mango\npulp was always meant to be at the rate of 12%, the same has to be taken as, for all the times the rate was only\n12% so far as mango pulp is concerned.\n8. In that view , we cannot accept the argument of learned Government Pleader that the Circular is only\nprospective in nature The said argument is accordingly set aside and for the reasons stated above and\nfollowing the order in W.P.No.17267 of 2022 and for the reasons mentioned therein, the writ petition is\nallowed as prayed for . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

The order passed by the Assistant Commissioner (State Tax)-1st responde nt herein vide proceedings\nNo.F .Y.2018-19(GST), dated 18.11.2022, is under challenge in the present Writ Petition filed under Article\n226 of the Constitution of India.\n3. Anterior to the impugned order , the Assistant Commissioner (State Tax) issued a show-cause notice dated\n22.06.2022 to the petitioner . There is absolutely no controversy with regard to the factum of filing explanation\non 01.08.2022 in response to the said show-cause notice issued by the Assista nt Commissioner (State Tax).\nThe principle contention advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the instant Writ Petition is that\nin contravention of the mandatory requirements of law as provided under sub-section (4) of Section 75 of the\nCentral Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act, 2017\") and in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice, the Assistant Commissioner (State Tax)-1st respondent herein passed the\nimpugned order and as such, the impugned order is liable to be set aside on the said ground.AJAY4. On the other hand, Sri Sai Kumar , learned Assistant Government Pleader contends that since the 1st\nrespondent herein issued a show-cause notice and the petitioner herein submitted an explanation in response\nto the same, it cannot be construed by any stretch of imagination that the impugned order is in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice and in contravention of the mandatory requirements of law .\nIn this context, it would be appropriate and apposite to refer to the Section 75 of the Act, 2017, which deals\nwith the general provisions relating to determination of tax. Sub-section (4) of section 75 of the Act, 2017,\nmandates that an opportunity of hearing  shall be granted where a request is received in writing from the\nperson  char geable with tax or penalty or any adverse decision is contemplated against such person .\n5. A perusal of the order impugned in the present Writ Petition discloses in unequivocal terms that the\npetitioner made a request to the respond ents to afford an opportunity of personal  hearing . The impu gned order\nalso states that vide reference 1st cited in the impugned order , notice was issued affording an oppo rtunity of\npersonal  hearing  and the petitioner failed to avail the same. However , the fact remains that the 1st reference in\nthe impugned order is only an authorization issued by the Joint Commissioner , but not the notice said to have\nbeen issued to the petitioner , affording an opportunity of personal  hearing . The above aspects drives this Court\ntowards irresistible conclusion that the 1st respondent herein passed the impugn ed order not only in violation\nof mandatory provisions under sub-sec tion (4) of section 75 of the Act, 2017, but also in violation of the\nprinciples of natural justice. Therefore, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.\n6. Accordingly , the Writ Petition is allowed, setting aside the impugned order dated 18.11.2022 passed by the\n1st respondent. However , this order will not preclude the authorities from passing order afresh, after hearing\nthe petitioner . No order as to costs.\n7.

The deadline for filing the\napplication of two years relevant period, ended on 21.03.2024. The deficiency memo was issued to that effect\nwith an advice to the petitioner that a fresh refund application may be filed after removal of deficiencies.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner subm its that the petitioner's application was within a period of two years\nfrom the relevant date under Section 54(1) R/w. Section 54(14) explanation 2(a)(i) of CGST Act. Such\nprovisions read as under:\n\"54. Refund of tax\n(1) Any person claim ing refund of any tax and interest, if any, paid on such tax or any other amount paid\nby him, may make an application before the expiry of two years from the relevant date in such form and\nmanner as may be prescribed:\nPROVIDED  that a registered person, claiming refund of any balance in the electronic cash ledger in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-section (6) of section 49, may claim such refund in [such form\nand] manner as may be prescribed.\n(14) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, no refund under subsection (5) or sub-section (6)\nshall be paid to an applicant, if the amount is less than one thousand rupees.\nExplanation:  For the purposes of this section,-\n(2) \"relevant date\" means-\n(a) in the case of goods exported out of India where a refund of tax paid is available in respect of goods\nthemselves or , as the case may be, the inputs or input services used in such goods,-\n(i) if the goods are exported by sea or air, the date on which the ship or the aircraft in which such\ngoods are loaded, leaves India\"\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the necessary documents were filed before the\nauthority but the same has not been considered and if the same had been taken into consideration, date of the\napplication of refund was within the period of two (02) years from the relevant date.\n6. The question involved is whether the petitioner's application was within the period of two years from the\nrelevant date or not. The authority has taken a view that it was beyond the period of two years and barred by\nlimitation. The submission is that the documents filed by the petitioner were not considered.\n7. The petitioner has got the statutory alternative remedy of appeal against the order of rejection of claim for\nrefund. The argument as advanced before us, is not such an argument, which cannot be taken before the\nappellate authority . The 'relevant date' requires determination in view of Section  54(14), explanation 2(a)(i) of\nthe Act on consideration of the documents, as submitted, filed by the petitioner , to arrive a conclusion, on\nwhat date the ship in which goods were loaded left India. In the exercise of the writ jurisdiction, this Court\nconsiders it not appropriate, at this stage to determine such question which is a disputed question of fact and\nrequires for its determination the evidence. The said exercise, can be done effectively by the appellate\nauthority . Consequently , we are not inclined to entertain the writ petition.AJAY8. At this stage, learne d counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner may approach the same authority\nwhich vide deficienc y memo has alread y provided that the petitioner may file fresh application after removal\nof the deficiency . He submits that such liberty may also been given to the petitioner .\n9. In view of the aforesaid, leaving it open to the petitioner to approach the statutory alternative appellate\nforum or the compe tent authority in view of the deficiency memo, as may be advised, this Writ Petition is\ndismissed, on the ground of availability of statutory alternative remedy .\n10. No orders as to costs.\n11. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

It opted for paying tax under\ncomposite scheme as per the procedure contemplated under section 10(1) of the GST Act.\n\u25a0 The petitioner's claim for payment of tax under the composite scheme was rejected on the ground that the\nturnover of petitioner for the 'previous year' under the VAT regime was Rs. 2.09 crores and notice was\nissued in terms of section 74 and section 10(5) stating that she was liable to pay CGST at the rate of 14\nper cent and SGST at the rate of 14 per cent from the date of initial registration, i.e., from 1-7-2017 and\ndemand had been confirmed along with interest and penalty .\n\u25a0 On writ, the petitioner pleaded that section 10(1) does not prescribe inclusion of VAT regime for the\npurpose of deciding the tax to be paid under section 10(1) and that the provisions of GST Act are not\nretrospective in operation and that the word 'preceding financial year' has no relevance for the taxes paid\nfor the financial year 2017-18.\nHELD\n \n\u25a0 While a reading of section 10(1) would show that where the aggregate turnover in the preceding financial\nyear does not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs, the registered taxpayer may opt to pay tax as prescribed, but not\nexceeding 1 per cent of the turnover in State in case of manufacturer; 2 1/2 per cent of the turnover in case\nof persons engaged in making supplies referred to in clause (b) of paragr aph 6 of Schedule II; and 1/2 per\ncent of the turnover in State in case of other suppliers. [Para 1 1]\n\u25a0 It may be true that the petitioner had paid GST under a composite scheme as per the option exercised in\nthe web portal, for nearly four quarters, but, the option exercised by the petitioner was self-declaratory ,\nwhich requires verification. Therefore, the argument of the department that it took sometime for the\nauthorities to examine the options exercised by all the taxpayers in the State cannot be brushed aside.\nMerely because the petitioner has exerc ised an option (which should be correct one) and that it took time\nfor the authorities to verify the genuinity or otherwise of the option exercised, it cannot stop the\ndepartment from directing the petitioner to pay tax as regulated under the provisions of the GST Act, if the\noption exercised was found to be incorrect. [Para 12]\n\u25a0 If the word 'preceding financial year' is restricted to the period commencing from GST regime, then all the\nassessees, who have submitted their returns with false declarations in the GST  regime for the financial\nyear 2017 -18, would go scot free and would not be liable to pay any tax, as there would not be any\npreceding financial year in the GST regime for the period 2017-18. This could not have been the intention\nof the Legislature at all. If the intention of the Legislature was to exclude the declarations made under\nVAT regime, the same would have found place in section 10(1) of the Act itself.  As the tax to be paid is to\nbe determined under the new regime, the Legislature thought it fit to fix a limit in the turnover of the\npreceding financial year for the purpose of extending the benefit under the composite scheme. A reading\nof the objects and reasons and the provisions of GST Act makes it clear that GST Act has only replaced\nVAT Act. All the taxes to be paid under VAT are subsumed into a single tax called GST, simplifying the\ntax collec tion proce ss and making it easier not only to the customer , but also the State and Central\nauthorities. [Para 13]\n\u25a0 Therefore, the argument that the turnover in the financial year starting from 1-7-2017 has only to be taken\ninto consi deration ignoring the previous turnover in the VAT regime does not sound to reason, because\nwhen the Legislatur e at more than one place used the word 'preceding financial year' it would only mean\nthat as on 1-7-2017,  the turnover of the previous year under the VAT regime has to be reckoned with for\nthe purpos e of extending benefit under GST regime, provided the self-declarations made are correct. It is\nalso to be noted that if during the course of business in subsequent year, the turnover comes down, such a\ndeclaration can be made seeking reduction of tax liability . But, the turnover of the previous year declared\nunder a different tax collection process cannot be eschewed for fixing the liability under a new tax\ncollection process. As stated earlier , by switching over from VAT to GST syste m, tax payment/collection\non intra-State supply of goods is being continued, but, however , in a different mode, thereby avoiding\ninconvenience and hardship to one and all. [Para 14]\n\u25a0 In the instant case, the dispute insofar as interpretation of the word 'previous financial year' arose only forthe financ ial year 2017-18, as the GST regime commenced from 1-7-2017. If the intention of the\nLegislature was that the turnover of the financial year under GST regime is only to be taken into\nconsideration, then there would have been a clarification of the word 'preceding financial year'. Section\n10(1) would not carry any meaning of such an interpretation, as sought by the petitioner , namely , the\nturnover in the VAT regime is not to be excluded while computing the tax liability and if such a narrow\ninterpretation to section 10(1) is given, many of the businessmen would not only escape payment of GST\nfor the year 2017-18, though the self-declaration made is incorrect or false, but also end up paying\nminimum GST though their turnover is on a higher side. It is to be noted here that word 'preceding\nfinancial year' is appearing at more than one place in section 10 itself, hence, it cannot be said that there\nwas any error in usage of the word 'prec eding' in section 10. The Legislature was conscious enough, when\nthe word 'preceding ' was used before the word 'financial year' in section 10(1) and also in the second\nproviso to section 10(1)( c), while extending benefits under a scheme. The Legislature in its wisdom\nobserved that such a benefit can be extended to those whose turnover in the previous financial year does\nnot exceed Rs. 50 lakhs. Therefore, the word 'preceding' appearing before the word 'financial year' cannot\nbe ignored  and if done, one would be doing mockery of the words 'financial year does not exceed Rs. 50\nlakhs'. Therefore, to fix a parameter for extending the benefits under the scheme and for payment of less\ntax in case of manuf acturers and for those engaged in making supplies, the Legislature though it fit to take\ninto account the turnover of the previous financial year. Insofar as the financial year 2017-18 under GST\nregime is concerned, the preceding financial year would be 2016-17 under the VAT regime. The collection\nof tax under the GST  Act, 2017 is not in addition to the provisions of VAT, but, this is being introduced as\na substitute to VAT Act to deal with both goods and services, so as to main tain uniformity across the\nlength and breadth of the country . This has been introduced to meet the requirements under the\nrecommendations of the GST Council, in which all the States and Union territories are the stakeholders.\n[Para 15]\n\u25a0 Hence, there is no illegality in taking into consideration the previous year's turnover (under VAT regime)\nfor the purpose of extending benefits under the composite scheme or for collecting taxes and penalty .\n[Para 16]\n\u25a0 Accordingly , the writ petition is dismissed.\nCASES REFERRED T O\n \nMc Dowell & Co. Ltd.  v. CTO [1985] 22 T axman 1 1 (SC)  (para 6).\nP.S.P. Sur esh Kumar , Adv . for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nC. Praveen Kumar , J. - The petitioner firm, represented by its proprietrix, was doing business in furniture\nafter obtaining permission and licence  from the concerned Departments, including erstwhile Sales Tax\nDepartment. When GST Act came into force, the petitioner , along with other dealers, got registered and\nobtained GST regist ration number  vide registration No. 37AABP A9728J1ZJ from the Department, which was\nwith effect from 1-7-2017. The petitioner claims to have opted for paying tax under composite scheme as per\nthe procedure contemplated under section 10(1) of GST Act and got it registered through GST portal. The\npetitioner has been filing GST returns and Form GSTR-IV from the quarter ending September , 2017 and the\ntaxes were  paid as per the said scheme, which postulates payment of 1% of GST on the turn over. According\nto the petitioner , the Department accept ed the taxes paid/returns filed, till the date of issuance of show cause\nnotice by the 3rd respondent on 14-2-2018, wherein the action of the petitioner claiming payment of tax under\nthe composite scheme was rejected on the ground that the turnover of petitioner for the \"previous year\" under\nthe VAT regime was Rs. 2.09 crores. The petitioner is said to have given an explanation to the show cause\nnotice, but the same was rejected on 26-7-2018 in Form-GSTCMP-07. Consequently , the petitioner was\nissued with a show cause notice on 27-7-2018, in terms of section 74 and section 10(5) of the State GST Act,\nstating that she is liable to pay S.GST @ 14% and C.GST @ 14% from the date of initial registration i.e.,\nfrom 1-7-2017. Though an explanation was given stating that she is not liable to pay an amount of Rs.\n15,93,708/-, as demanded in the show cause notice, the same was rejected by the 3rd respondent on 19-9-2018\nconfirming the demand along with interest and penalty . Challenging the order of the 3rd respondent, the\npetitioner preferred an appeal before the 2nd respondent, but the same was rejected on 12-2-2020. Aggrieved\nby the said order , the present writ petition came to be filed in the month of June, 2020.2. Sri P.S.P. Suresh Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner , would contend that the orders passed by the\n2nd and 3rd respondents directing the petitioner to pay GST @ 28% from 1-7-2017 is illegal, improper and\nincorrect. According to him, the respondents having accepted the option exercised by the petitioner in the web\nportal and having permitted him to pay tax at 1% of the total turn over in terms of the composite scheme,\ncannot now turn around and reject the option exercised and consequently direct the petitioner to pay GST as\nper the regular rates. He would further plead that a reading of section 10(1) of the Act, does not anywhere\nprescribe inclusion of VAT regime for the purpose of deciding the tax to be paid under section 10(1) of GST\nAct. In other words,  his plea is that the provisions of GST Act are not retrospective in operation and that the\nword \"preceding financial year\" has no relevance for the taxes paid for the financial year 2017-2018. He\nfurther pleads that even if the turn over from 1-7-2017 is taken into consideration, the petitioner's turn over\nwould be below Rs. 1 crore and hence the word 'preceding financial year' appea ring in section 10(1) would be\nfrom financial year, after the GST regime came into force and not otherwise. He took us through the\nprovisions of GST Act in support of his plea.\n3. The learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes opposed the same contending that the option\nexercised by the petitioner in the web portal cannot be accepted without due verification. Merely because the\npetitioner has exercised an option, which was on his own, and that the authorities have collected the taxes for\nfour quarters basing on self-declaration, the same does not by itself mean that the authorities have accepted\nthe scheme opted by the petitioner . He pleads that having regard to the fact that the new regime came into\neffect from  1-7-2017 , it took some time for the officials to process all the options exercised and in the process\naccepted the tax paid. Hence, urges that this will not estop the respondents from exercising the power to\ncancel the option exercised by the petiti oner. According to him, if really the intention of the legislature was to\nexclude the provisions of the VAT Act, or make the provisions of GST prospective in operation, there would\nhave been  a reference to that effect in section 10 of GST Act itself. In the absence of the same, it cannot be\ninferred that the word 'preceding year' excludes the turn over declared during the VAT regime. Apart from\nthat, he pleads that under Sub-Section 1 of Section 10, any person, who files an intimation to pay tax in the\nsaid provision, has to file form GST - CMP-03 (Rule 3(4)) intimating detai ls of stock as on the date of\nexercise of option for composition levy, but in the absence of the same, the petitioner cannot claim that the\nturnover was less than the prescribed norm warranting applicability of section 10(1) of the GST Act.\n4. The point that arise s for consideration is whether the petitioner is entitled for payment of GST as per the\ncomposite scheme, as his turn over after the GST regime came to force is less than Rs. 1 crore.\n5. Value Added Tax is a consumption tax that is assessed on products at each stage of the production process\nfrom labour and raw materials to the sale of the final product. It is an indirect tax where the charges are levied\nat the State level, within every production and distribution level of commodities and services. It is charged at\nthe sale point. While  under GST, particularly as per Section 9 of the GST Act, all the taxes mentioned under\nthe VAT regime are proposed to be subsumed into a single tax called the Goods and Services Tax, which will\nbe levied on supply of goods or service s or both at each stage of supply chain starting from manufacture or\nimport and till the last retail level. So, basically any tax that is presently being levied by the Central or State\nGovernment on the supply of goods or services is going to be conver ged into GST. The GST can be called as\na unifier that will integrate various taxes levied by the State and Centre and provide a platform for forging an\neconomic union of the country . It is also to be noted that after the onset of GST regime, transitional provisions\ncame to be introduce d with the sole object of allowing seamless flow of credit and the supplies under the GST\nregime which have already suffered tax once, do not suffer again. It is to be noted here that the Goods and\nServices Tax has replaced central and state indirect taxes such as VAT, excise duty and service tax and it has\ncome into effect from  1st July, 2017. As observed earlier , GST has eliminated the cascading effect of taxes on\nthe econom y, meaning thereby , GST has eliminated tax on tax levied on a product at every step of the sale. It\nappears that essential vision is to create one nation and one market wherein all the goods, irrespective of their\nterritory suf fer the same tax and have the same costs.\n6. Keeping in view the objects and reasons and the purpose for which GST Act came into force and also the\nobservations made by the Apex Court in Mc Dowell & Co. Ltd. v. CTO [1985] 22 Taxman 1, namely , that\n\"there is no equity about a tax, there is no presumption as to a tax, nothing is to be read in and nothing is to be\nimplied\", we shall now proceed to deal with the issue involved in the present case.\n7. It is now to be seen whether the autho rities were right in directing the petitioner to pay tax at 28% (14%\nSGST and 14% CGST) and also as to what the word \"preceding financial year\" appearing in Section 10(1) of\nAct would mean?8. In order to appreciate the same, it will be useful to refer to section 10(1) of the AP GST Act, which is as\nunder :\n\"10. Composition levy.\u2014 (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act but subject\nto the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 9, a registered person, whose aggregate turnover in\nthe preceding financial year did not exceed fifty lakh rupees may opt to pay, in lieu of the tax payable by\nhim under  sub-sectio n (1) of section 9, an amount of tax calculated at such rate as may be prescribed, but\nnot exceeding,-\nRate of T ax of Composition levy\n(a) one percent of the turnover in State in case of manufacturer ,\n(b) two and a half percent of the turnover in State in case of persons engaged in making\nsupplies referred to in clause ( b) of paragraph 6 of Schedule II; and\n(c) half percent of the turnover in State in case of other suppliers, subject to such conditions\nand restrictions as may be prescribed :\nProvided  that the Government may, by notification, increase the said limit of fifty lakh rupees to such\nhigher amount, not exceeding one crore and fifty lakh rupees, as may be recommended by the Council.\nProvided further  that a person who opts to pay tax under clause (a) or clause (b) or clause (c) may\nsupply services (other than those referr ed to in clause (b) of parag raph 6 of Schedule II;), of value not\nexceeding ten per cent of turn over in the State in the preceding financial year or five lakh rupees,\nwhichever is higher .\"\n9. A reading  of section 10(1) of A.P. GST Act, 2017 would indicate that notwiths tanding anything contrary to\nthe provis ions of the Act, but, subject to sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 9, a registered person, whose\naggregate turnover in the \"preceding financial year\" does not exceed fifty lakh rupees may opt to pay tax as\nprescribed, but not exceeding 1% of the turn over in State in case of manufacturer; 2 \u00bd % of the turn over in\nState in case of persons engaged in making supplies referred to in clause (b) of parag raph 6 of Schedule II;\nand \u00bd % of the turn over in State in case of other suppliers.\n10. Sub-sectio n (3) of section 10 postulates that the option availed of by a registered person under sub-section\n(1) shall lapse with effect from the day on which his aggregate turnover durin g a financial year exceeds the\nlimit specified under sub-section (1).\n11. From the above it is pellucid that option exercised by the registered person under sub-section (1) of section\n10 would lapse if his aggregate turn over during the financial year exceeds the limit prescribed under sub-\nsection (1). While a reading of section 10(1), inter alia , would show that where the aggregate turn over in the\npreceding financial year does not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs, the registered tax payer may opt to pay tax as\nprescribed, but not exceeding 1% of the turn over in State in case of manufactu rer; 2 \u00bd% of the turn over in\ncase of persons enga ged in making supplies referred to in clause (b) of paragraph 6 of Schedule II; and \u00bd% of\nthe turn over in State in case of other suppliers.\n12. It may be true that the petitioner had paid GST under a composite scheme as per the option exercised in\nthe web portal, for nearly four quarters, but, the option exercised by the petitioner was self-declaratory , which\nrequires verification. Therefore, the argument of the learned Government Pleade r that it took sometime for the\nauthorities to examine the options exercised by all the taxpayers in the State cannot be brushed aside. Merely\nbecause the petitioner has exercised an option (which should be a correct one) and that it took time for the\nauthorities to verify the genuinity or otherwise of the option exercised, canno t estop the respondents from\ndirecting the petitioner to pay tax as regulated under the provisions of the GST Act, if the option exercised\nwas found to be incorrect.\n13. Therefore , the word 'preceding financia l year' appearing in section 10(1) of the Act is the crux of the issue.\nIf the word 'precedi ng financial year' is restricted to the period commencing from GST regime, then all the\nassesses, who have submitted their returns with false declarations in the GST regime for the financial year\n2017-2018, would go scot free and would not be liable to pay any tax, as there would not be any preceding\nfinancial year in the GST regime for the period 2017-2018. This could not have been the intention of the\nlegislature at all. If the intention of the legislature was to exclude the declarati ons made under VAT regime,\nthe same would have found place in section 10(1) of the Act itself. As the tax to be paid is to be determinedPOOJAunder the new regime, the legislature thought it fit to fix a limit in the turn over of the preceding financial year\nfor the purpose of extending the benefit under the composite scheme. A reading of the objects and reasons and\nthe provis ions of GST Act makes it clear that GST Act has only replaced VAT Act. All the taxes to be paid\nunder VAT are subsumed into a single tax called GST, simplifying the tax collection process and making it\neasier not only to the customer , but also the State and Central authorities.\n14. Therefore, the argument that the turn over in the financial year starting from 1-7-2017 has only to be taken\ninto consideration ignoring the previous  turn over in the VAT regime does not sound to reason, because when\nthe legislature at more than one place used the word 'preceding financial year', it would only mean that as on\n1-7-2017, the turn over of the previous year under the VAT regime has to be reckoned with for the purpose of\nextending benefit under GST regime, provided the self-declarations made are correct. It is also to be noted\nthat if during the course of business in subsequent year, the turnover comes down, such a declaration can be\nmade seeking reduction of tax liability . But, the turn over of the previous year declared under a different tax\ncollection process cannot be eschewed for fixing the liability under a new tax collection process. As stated\nearlier , by switching over from VAT to GST system, tax payment/collection on intra state supply of goods is\nbeing continued, but, however , in a different mode, thereby avoiding inconvenience and hardship to one and\nall.\n15. In the instant case, the dispute in so far as interpretation of the word 'previous financial year' arose only for\nthe financial year 2017-2018, as the GST regime commenced from 1-7-2017. If the intention of the legislature\nwas that the turnove r of the financial year under GST regime is only to be taken  into consideration, then there\nwould have been a clarification of the word 'preceding financial year'. Section 10 (1) of the Act would not\ncarry any meaning if such an interpretat ion, as sought by the petitioner , is given , namely , the turn over in the\nVAT regime has to be excluded while computing the tax liability . If such a narrow interpretation to section\n10(1) is given, as observed earlier , many of the businessmen would not only escape payment of GST for the\nyear 2017-2018, though the self-declaration made is incorrect or false, but also end up paying minimum GST\nthough their turnover is on a higher side. It is to be noted here that word 'preceding financial year' is appearing\nat more than one place in section 10 itself, hence, it cannot be said that there was any error in usage of the\nword \"preceding\" in section 10. The legislature was conscious enough, when the word 'preceding' was used\nbefore the word 'financial year' in section 10(1) and also in the second proviso to section 10(1)( c), while\nextending benefits under a scheme. The legislature in its wisdom observed that such a benefit can be extended\nto those whose turn over in the previou s financial year does not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs. Therefore, the word\n'preceding' appearing before the word 'financial year' cannot be ignored and if done, one would doing\nmockery of the words 'financial year does not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs'. Therefore, to fix a parameter for\nextending the benefits under the scheme and for payment of less tax in case of manufacturers and for those\nengaged in making supplies, the legisla ture thought it fit to take into account the turn over of the previous\nfinancial year. In so far as the financial year 2017-2018 under GST regime is concerned, the preceding\nfinancial year would be 2016-2017 under the VAT regime. The collection of tax under the GST Act, 2017 is\nnot in addition to the provisions of VAT, but, this is being introduced as a substitute to VAT Act to deal with\nboth good s and services, so as to maintain uniformity across the length and breadth of the country . This has\nbeen introduced to meet the requirements under the recommendations of the GST council, in which all the\nStates and Union territories are the stakeholders.\n16. Hence, we find no illegality in taking into consideration the previous year's turn over (under VAT regime)\nfor the purpose of extending benefits under the composite scheme or for collecting taxes and penalty .\n17. Accordingly , the W rit Petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.\n18. Consequently , miscellaneous petitions pending, if any , shall stand closed."}

The averments made in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition show that the petitioner herein, who\nwas engag ed in business of trading of coal, claims that he is entitled for refund of tax paid on such supplies, in\nterms of Section 54 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 [for short, \"CGST Act\"] and Andhra\nPradesh State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 [for short, \"A.P. G.S.T . Act\"] read with Rule 89 of GST\nRules. Accordingly , on 15-9-2021, the petitioner filed refund application for the tax period July, 2017 to\nMarch, 2018 and April, 2018 to March, 2019. Thereafter , a notice for rejection  of the application for refund\nwas issued on 25-9- 2021 for both the years on the ground of limitation for whic h, a reply came to be filed by\nthe petitioner on 1-10-2021. However , respondent No. 1 passed an order on 5-10-2021 rejecting the\napplication for refund, on the ground that the application made by the petitioner is barred by limitation. Since\nthe applica tion came  to be made beyond the period of limitation prescribed unde r section 54(14) of the CGST\nAct coupled with Circular , dated 20-7-2021, issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Revenue, respondent No. 1 passed the order , dated 5-10-2021, rejecting the request of the\npetitioner . Assailing the same, the present writ petition came to be filed.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner mainly submits that in view of the subsequent Notification, dated 5-7-\n2022, of the Govern ment of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect\nTaxes and Customs, the rejection of application for refund is bad in law .\n5. Learned Governme nt Pleader for Com mercial Tax would submit that the order passed by the authorities\nbasing on the Circular , dated 20-7-2021, cannot be found fault with. He took us through clause 3(iii) and\nclause 4( b) of the said Circular  and submits that there is no illegality in the order passed by respondent No. 1.\n6. A perusal of the material on record would show that the refund applicatio n came to be filed by the\npetitioner on 15-9-2021 for the tax period from July, 2017 to March, 2018 and April, 2018 to March, 2019.\nThough learned Government Pleader would contend that the said application came to be made beyond the\nperiod of limitation,  but the learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that a reading of clause 2 to the\nExplanation  to Section 54 of the CGST Act would show that the 'relevant date' is prescrib ed only for goods\nexported out of India, but there is no provision determining the 'relevant date' in respect of the supplies to SEZ\nunits, which are considered as zero-rated sales under section 16 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act,\n2017 [for short, \"IGST Act\"]. It would be relevant to note that the recent Notif ication issued by Government\nof India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, dated 5-\n7-2022, clearly postulates that in respect of period 1st March, 2020 to 28th February , 2022, the computation of\nperiod of limitation, for filing refund application under section 54 or section 55 of the said Act shall stand\nexcluded.\n7. In view of the above, it cannot be said that the application for refund was made beyond the period of\nlimitation. Accordingly , the Writ Petition is allowed and the order , dated 5-10-20 21, passed by respondent No.\n1 is set aside and the matter is remanded back to respondent No. 1 for considera tion afresh in accordance with\nlaw. There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition shall stand closed.* In favour of assessee/Matter remanded."}

Heard Shaik Jeelani Basha, learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Government Pleader for\nCommercial T ax for the respondents and perused the material on record.\n2. With the consent of learned counsels for the parties, the present writ petition is being decided finally at this\nstage.\n3. The petitioner's GST registration was cancelled by order dated 13.06.2023 after show cause notice dated\n09.01.2023. The petitioner filed appeal under Section 107 of Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Act,\n2017 (for short 'APGST Act') on 21.12.2023 which has been rejected vide order dated 12.02.2024 impugned\nin this petition, at the admission stage on the ground that it was barred by limitation and beyond the\ncondonable statutory period.\n4. The appeal was beyond the condonable period by 73 days as per the impugned appellate order . Learned\ncounsel for the petitioner disputing the same submits that the delay after excluding condonable period by the\nAppellate Authority is 69 days.5. Secti on 107 of APGST Act provides for the appeal to be filed within a period of limitation of three months\nfrom the date on which the decision or order appealed against is communicated to the appellant. As per sub-\nsection (4) of Sectio n 107, the Appellate Authority may, if he is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by\nsufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the said period of limitation, allow it to be presented within\na further period of one month. The appe llate authority under the statutory provi sion has no power to condone\nthe delay beyond the condonable statutory period. Consequently , the petitioner's appeal was rejected.\n6. The cause of the delay in not preferring the appeal within the statutory period of limitation as also the\ncondonable period so stated was that the petitioner's ill health, difficulty in walking and being under the\nDoctor's Supervision. In support thereof Doctor's Certificate was filed as also the petitioner's af fidavit.\n7. The learned counse l for the petitioner has placed reliance in the case of W.P.No.17349 of 2023 decided on\n04.08.2023, in which a Coordinate Bench of this Court, after finding that the sufficient cause was shown to\ncondone the delay in filing the appeal, remitted the matter to the appellate authority , by imposing cost of\nRs.20,000/-.\n8. The Appellate Auth ority in the impugned order did not dispute the cause of delay nor found that such cause\nwas not sufficient. There was proof filed in support of the cause for not preferring the appeal in time. The\nrejection is only because beyond condonable period, the delay could not be condoned by the Appellate\nAuthority .\n9. Learned Government Pleader also does not dispute that in view of the material before the Appellate\nAuthority , the cause shown was considered as suf ficient by Appellate Authority .\n10. The cause as shown is found sufficient to condone the delay in filing appeal before the Appellate\nAuthority .\n11. The impugned order in view of Section 107 of APGST Act does not suffer from any illegality , as the\nappellate authority cannot condone the delay beyond statutory condonable period but considering that there\nwas sufficient cause for not preferring appeal in time, the interest of justice requires condonation of the delay\nand adjudication of the matter on merit  by Appellate Authority . The appeal is a valuable statutory right. In\nexercise of the writ jurisdiction to do complete justice and provide opportunity of hearing on merits of the\nappeal, we condone the delay by imposing costs of Rs.20,000/-. The appellate  authority shall consider and\ndecide the appeal on merits in accordan ce with law, expeditiously . The Costs shall be deposited in two (02)\nweeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order , before the appellate authority .\n12.

The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a proprietary concern engaged in the business of purchase and sale of iron scrap and\npetitioner is registered with GSTIN No.37AFFPF2876K1Z5 on the rolls of 1st respondent. The\npetitioner has been regularly filing monthly returns and making payment of taxes as per GST Act,\n2017 after availing ITC.\n(b) While so, 1st respondent issued a show cause notice dated 22.06.2023 U/s 29 of SGST Act r/w Rule\n21 of CGST Rules, 2017 proposing to cancel the registration of the petitioner on the alleged ground\nthat the suppliers of the goods to the purchaser has availed ITC without actual receipt of goods and\nindulged in passing on such credit to the petitioner without supply of goods. The 1st respondent, in\nthis regard relied on certain alleged reports allegedly received by him in respect of few suppliers by\nthe respec tive GST authorities. However , the petitioner was not supplied the reports allegedly sent\nby respective GST authorities of the suppliers of the petitioner . In spite of his obligation under law\nto supply all the incriminating material  along with show cause notice to enab le the petitioner to\nrespond in an effective manner even the allegations leveled in the show cause notice were also not\ncorrect. They are baseless and contrary to the Assessment Order .\n(c) In respons e to the show cause notice, the petitioner filed a detailed objection s dated 26.06.2023\ndisputing the allegations made in the show cause notice and requested to drop the proposed action.\nPetitioner contended that if for argume nt sake the allegations of fake invoices and claim of ITC\nwithout movement of goods as alleged by the 1st respondent is admitted to be true and consequently\nthere is no purchase  of goods by the petitioner , equally there cannot be any sale of goods by the\npetitioner , inasmuch  as, without inward receipt of goods, there cannot be outw ard sale of goods.\nThus, if the 1st responde nt disbelieves the purchases, he should equally disbelieves the sales.\nHowever , without considering all these aspects, the 1st respondent passed the impugned order dated\n15.07.2023 cancelli ng the registration of the petitioner on untenable ground s and also on the\ngrounds which were not raised in the show cause notice. The impugned order is in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice as the alleged reports issued by the GST authorities which are the basis\nfor issuing show cause notice were not supplied to the petitioner . It is further submitted that since\nthe petitioner was not properly advised,  he could not file a petition U/s 30 of CGST Act, 2017 for\nrevocation of registration.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. Heard arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Redd y and learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T axes for respondents.\n4. The pivotal argument of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Reddy is that the petitioner\nnever indulged in bogus purchases or supplies to accommodate his suppliers to claim ITC fraudulently . While\nissuing show cause notice, the 1st respondent who claims to have relied on certain reports allegedly submitted\nto him by certain GST Authorities, has not forwarded those reports to inform the petitioner with which of the\ndealers the petitioner made bogus trans actions to facilitate them to claim ITC wrongfully , so as to give an\nopportunity to the petitioner to submi t an effective reply . Learned counsel thus vehemently argued that\nprinciples of natural justice have been violated and therefore the impugned order liable to be set aside.\n5. Per contra , learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes argued that the writ petition is not\nmaintainable, inasm uch as, the petitioner has alternative remedy to file a petiti on U/s 30 of APGST Act for\nrevocation of cancellation or to file an appeal against the impugned order before the Appellate Authority U/s\n107 of the APGST Act. Learned Government Pleader argued that without pursuing the alternative reliefs the\npetitioner cannot file the writ petition. Nextly , learned Government Pleader argued that the show cause notice\nis self-explanatory as the show cause notice contains the particulars of the non-existent dealers from whomKAR TIKthe petitio ner obtain ed bogus invoices and therefore the petitioner cannot claim non-supply of material and\nviolation of principles of natural justice. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow ?\n7. POINT : As can be seen, the prime conte ntion of learned Government Pleader is that since the petitioner has\nan alternat ive remedy U/s 30 of GST Act to file an application for revocation of cancellation or to assail the\nimpugned order in the appeal U/s 107 of GST Act, the writ petition is not maintainable. Per contra, the\ncontention of the petitioner is that required particulars are not furnished in the show cause notice dated\n22.06.2023 and thereby principles of natural justice have been violated and therefore, the writ petition is\nmaintainable. Law is no more res-integr a with regard to the maintainability of writ petition when alternative\nremedy is available to a party . In Whirlpool Corporation  v. Registrar of Trade Marks  (1998) 8 SCC 1\n=MANU/SC/0664/1998, the Apex Court has observed thus:\n\"14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is\nnot limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not\nonly for issuing writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, prohibition, Qua Warranto and\nCertiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution\nbut also for \"any other purpose\".\n15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has\ndiscretion to entertain or not to enterta in a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself\ncertain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court\nwould not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been  consistently held by this\ncourt not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely , where the Writ Petition has been filed\nfor the enforcement of any of the Funda mental rights or where there has been a violation of the principle\nof natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act\nis challen ged. Ther e is a plethora of case law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic\nwhirlpool we would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they\nstill hold the field.\"\n8. Thus, Hon'ble Apex Court held that in certain contingencies viz., when writ petition is filed for enforcement\nof fundamental rights, or where there  has been a violation of principles of natural justice or when the\nproceedings impugned are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an act is challenged, the writ petition\ncould be maintainable in spite of availability of alternative remedy . In the instant case the petitioner banks\nupon the violation of principles of natur al justice to maintain the writ petition. In this context, a perusal of the\nshow cause notice dated 22.06.2023 shows that the 1st respondent has given required particulars of the non-\nexistent tax payers from whom the petitioner allegedly obtained bogus tax invoices. Therefore, we do not find\nvenom in the conte ntion of the petitioner that the show cause notice is bereft of required particulars and\nthereby the principles of natural justice  were violated. Admittedly , the petitio ner has alternative remedy to\nchallenge the impugned order which he did not avail. Therefore, we does not deserve any order in the writ\npetition. However , considering that the petitioner's registration has been cancelled and thereby he cannot\ncontinue his business activities, we deem  it apposite to give an opportunity to the petitioner to challenge the\nimpugned order either by way of filing a petition U/s 30 of the GST Act or to file an appeal within a\nreasonable time.\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is dismissed. However , giving an opportunity to the petitioner either to file an\napplication U/s 30 of the GST Act for revocation of cancellation, or to challeng e the impugned order by way\nof filing an appeal and the petitioner can avail either remedy within 15 days from the date of receipt of a copy\nof this order , in which case the concerne d authority shall pass an appropriate order on merits after affording an\nopportunity of hearing to both parties. No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications if any pending, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Heard  Sri P.S.P Suresh Kumar , learned counsel for the petitioner , and Sri\nT.C.D.Sekhar , learne d Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes appearing for the respondents. With their\nconsent and as the pleadings are complete, the writ petition is being disposed of at the admission stage.\n2. The present writ petition came to be filed seeking issuance of a Writ of Manda mus declaring the action of\nthe 3rd respondent in detaining the goods belonging to the petitioner vide order dated 28-3-2022 and\ncollecting an amount of Rs.4,87,694/- on the ground of mismatch of the company's name in the tax invoice as\nillegal, arbitrary and violative of principles of natural justice.\n3. The petitioner - M/s Bitumon Corporation India Pvt., Ltd., is engaged in the business of Bitumen products\nand sale of the said products within India. It is said that Bitumen is being imported to India and is sold to\nregular customers in India. In the instan t case, the Bitumen Grade VG 30 of 28.540 MT was dispatched from\na godown at Karnataka, under stock transfer and necessary tax invoice to be delivered at BITCOL, Kakinada.\nDuring the transit of the said material, the vehicle and the material were detained at Vijayawada check-post on\n28-3-2022 due to defective documents.\n4. The averments made in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition would show that the defective\ndocument pointed out by the 3rd respondent is that the delivery point in the tax invoice is shown as BITCOL,\nKakinada and not Bitumen Corporation India Private Limited. It is said that since the vehicle and goods\ndetained are very much essential, the petitioner has paid an amount of Rs.4,87,694/- as penalty and got\nreleased the vehicle  and the goods and thereafter , the present writ petition came to be filed challenging the\nseizure of the goods and collection of penalty .\n5. Reiteratin g the averments made in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition, learned counsel for the\npetitioner would submit that the 3rd respondent has not followed the procedure contemplated under law, more\nparticularly Section 129 of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 [for short, 'GST Act'] while seizing the\ngoods and the vehicle. Insofar as the ground of detention that Bitumen is being transported with defectivedocument, he would submit that the understanding of the authority detaining the vehicle is incorrect. In other\nwords, he submits that Bitumen Corporation India Private Limited and BITCOL are one and the same and the\nabbreviated form of Bitumen Corporation of India i.e., BITCOL is shown in the tax invoice. He further\nsubmits that a notice ought to have been  issued at-least after seizure, explaining the reasons for seizure, which\nis also not done.\n6. A counter came to be filed by the 3rd respondent disputing the averments made in the affidavit filed in\nsupport of the writ petition. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner , who filed the counter -affidavit,\ncategorically stated that the vehicle was intercepted on 28-3-2022 and it was found that conveyance is not\naccompanied by proper details in the tax invoice. As such, the vehicle was detained and enquiry was\nconducted wherein it was found that the buyer's name mismatched with the tax invoice. Notice was also given\nto the driver on the same day. Basing on the statement made by the driver , that the vehicle was transporting\ngoods to a destinatio n which is not reflected in the invoice, the same was seized. It is further stated that the\n3rd respondent issued FORM GST MOV -07 [Notice under Section 129(3) of the Central Goods and Services\nTax Act, 2017 and the State/Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017/under Section 20 of the\nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017] to the person in charge of the conveyance, proposing penalty of\nRs.4,87,694/- [CGST of Rs.2,43,847/- and SGST of Rs.2,43,847/-] and the petitioner was allowed to represent\nits case in defence.\n7. As seen from the record, in response  to the notice issued in Form GST MOV -07, the owner of the\ngoods/person in charge of the conveyance has come forward and paid tax and penalty as proposed. Therefore,\nthe applicable tax and penalty proposed were confirmed vide order of the 3rd respondent, under Section\n129(3) of the GST  Act, and vide release order in Form GST MOV -05 dated 28-3-2022 the goods and\nconveyance were released.\n8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that because of the need of the vehicle and the material, the\namount was paid, however on protest, and hence, the present writ petition came to be filed questioning the\nseizure and penalty imposed.\n9. At this stage, learn ed Government Pleader would contend that since the amount has been paid and the\nvehicle and the material were released, if the petitioner has any grieva nce with regard to the procedure\nfollowed by the 3rd respondent, it may have to prefer an appeal questioning the factual aspects involved as to\nwhy the vehicle was detained and under what circumstances, the penalty came  to be paid, in the absence of\nany default. The said argument of learned Government Pleader cannot be brushed aside, having regard to the\nfactual position.\n10. The issue s raised in this writ petition have to be dealt with basing on the factua l aspects. Since the Statute\nprovides an appeal under Section 107 of the GST Act, the petitioner can as well avail the same.\n11. For the aforesaid reasons, the Writ Petition is disposed of directing the petitioner to avail the alternative\nremedy of appeal, under Section 107 of the GST Act before Joint Commissioner concerned. There shall be no\norder as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition shall stand closed.\n\u25a0\u25a0\n*In favour of revenue."}

In the present Writ Petition, challenge is to the order dated 30-4-2021 passed  by respondent No. 1.-The\nDeputy Commissio ner of Central Tax, rejecting the refund claim of the petitioner for the tax period,\ncommencing from April, 2018 to Janua ry, 2019, relying on \"Relevant date\" prescribed under explanation (2)\nof Section 54 of the Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017. The petitioner herein is a registered dealer on\nthe rolls of respond ent No. 1 under the Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017, and is engaged in thebusiness of process of raw granite blocks and manufacture and export sales of polished granite slabs/tiles. The\npetitioner herein claimed refund of Rs.46,72,862/- towards tax period comm encing from April, 2018 to\nMarch, 2019 in Form RFD-01 dated 13-3-2021 under sub-section (3) of section 54 of the Central Goods and\nService Tax Act, 2017. Respondent No. 1 herein acknowledged the same,  vide Form RFD -02 dated  26-3-\n2021. Thereafter , respondent No. 1 herein issued a show cause notice in Form GST RFD-08 dated 26-3-2021.\nIn response to the same, the petitioner herein filed a reply on 2-4-2021, wherein the petitioner herein sought to\nplace reliance on the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation , In re\n[2021] 125 taxmann .com 151/164 SCL 717 (SC) . Respond ent No. 1, by way of an order dated 30-4-2021,\nwhich is the subject matter of the presen t Writ Petition, held that the petitioner herein is entitled for the refund\nof Rs. 6,07,516/- for the period from February , 2019 to March, 2019 as per rule 89(5) of the Central Goods\nand Services Tax Rules, 2017, read with section 54 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, and\nrejected the claim of the petitioner for the period commencing from April, 2018 to January , 2019. In the above\nbackground, the petitioner herein has come up before this Court with the present Writ Petition, obviously ,\naggrieved by the rejection of his claim by respondent No. 1 for the period commencing from April, 2018 to\nJanuary , 2019.\n3. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner , the order of respondent No. 1, to the extent the same\nwent against the petitioner herein, rejecting the petitioner's claim for the period commencing from April, 2018\nto January, 2019, is illegal, arbitrary and opposed to the provisions of section 54 of the Central Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017, and rule 89(5) of the rules framed thereunder . It is further contended by the learned\ncounsel that while dealing with the issue, respondent No. 1 herein failed to take into consideration the order\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation  (supra ). It is further\ncontended by the learned counsel that when a similar issue fell for consideration  before this Court, this Court,\nby way of an order A.G. Exports  v. Asstt. Com missioner State Tax [W. P. No. 3049 of 2022, dated 8-2-2022],\nhad set aside the order impugned in the said Writ Petition and remanded the matter for fresh consideration. In\nfact, a copy of the said order passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in W.P.No.3049 of 2022 is filed\nalong with the reply af fidavit of the writ petitioner .\n4. While strongly resisting the Writ Petition, it is contended by the learned Senior Standing Counsel,\nappearing for the respondents, that as the petitioner herein did not make any claim within the time stipulated\nin the statute, the petitioner herein is not entitled to any relief from this Court under article 226 of the\nConstitution of India.\n5. The information available before this Court, in clear and vivid terms, reveal s that seeking refund of the\namount for the period, commencing from April, 2018 to March, 2019, the petitioner herein made an\napplication on 13-3-2021 and there is absolutely no dispute with regard to either submission of the said claim\nor the receipt of the same by the respondent-authorities. It is also not in dispute that the petitioner herein filed\na detailed reply on 2-4-2021 in response  to the show cause notice dated 26-3-20 21. A reading of the said reply\nshows that the petitioner herein also referred to the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Suo Motu  Writ\nPetition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020. A perusal of the order under challenge shows that as per the provisions of the\nstatute, in order to get entitlement for refund of the period from April, 2018 to March, 2019, one should have\nfiled an application on or before 19-5-2020. But in the present case, the petitioner herein filed such application\non 13-3-2021. In this context, it may be appropriate to apposite to refer to the order of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt dated 08-3-2021 in Suo Motu  Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, by way\nof the aforementioned order , disposed of the said W rit Petition with the following directions :\n\"1. In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, application or proceeding, the period from\n15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021 shall stand excluded. Consequently , the balance period of limitation remaining\nas on 15-3-2020, if any , shall become available with ef fect from 15-3-2021.\n2. In cases  where the limitation would have expired during the period between 15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021,\nnotwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation remaining, all persons shall have a limitation\nperiod of 90 days from 15-3-2021. In the event the actual balance period of limitation remaining, with\neffect from 15-3-2021, is greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply .\n3. The period from  15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021 shall also stand excluded in computing the periods\nprescribed under sections 23(4) and 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12A of\nthe Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and provisions ( b) and ( c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct, 1881 and any other laws, which prescribed period( s) of limitation for instituting proceedings, outer\nlimits (within which the court or tribunal can condone delay) and termination of proceedings.\"KAR TIK6. It is very much apparent from the abov e order of the Hon'ble Apex Court that while computing the period\nof limitation for any suit, appeal, application or proceeding, the period from 15-3-2020 till 14-3-2021 is liable\nto be excluded. In view of the said order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and if the said period is excluded from\ncomputation of the period of limitation, the entire claim of the petitioner herein is liable to be accepted. In\nfact, by placing reliance on the said orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court\nin W.P.No.3049 of 2022, passed an order, setting aside the order impugned in the said Writ Petition and\nremanded the matter for fresh consideration by the authorities. It is further evident from a perusal of the\nimpugned order that though respondent No. 1 herein referred to the order passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court,\nrespondent No. 1 herein did not make any endeavour to consider the directions contained therein.\n7. For the aforesaid reasons, this Writ Petition is allowed, setting aside the order  dated 30-4-2021 passed by\nrespondent No. 1 to the extent of rejecting the claim for the period commencing  from April, 2018 to January ,\n2019 and the matter is remanded to the said extent for consideration and for passing appropriate orders by\ntaking into consideration the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the order dated 8-3-2021 passed in\nSuo Motu W rit Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020 .

The present Writ Petition came to be filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking the\nfollowing relief:-\n\"\u2026\u2026 to issue Writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ or order or direction declaring the\ninaction of the Resp ondents to reopen the portal immediately enabling the petitioner to file TRAN-1 and\nto claim Credit Carry Forward of Rs. 42,05,365/-, which is entitled by the petitioner , as per section\n140(3) of the CGST Act, 2017, as arbitr ary, contrary to the provisions of the GST Act, 2017, contrary to\nArticle 14, 19(1)( g) of the Constitution of India and also the same is in violation of principles of natural\njustice and consequently direct the respo ndents to redress the grievance of the petitioner forthwith, and inSBthe alternative, permit the petitioner to claim Credit Carry Forward of Rs. 42,05,365/- manually , in the\ninterest of justice and equity , consequently direct the 1st respondent not to insist for payment of Rs.\n41,16,841/- as per Notice in Form GST DRC 01, dated 2-7-2020 and pass \u2026\u2026\"\n3. Though various grounds are raised in the writ petition, learned counsel placed on record the order , passed\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Petitions for Union of India  v. Filco Trade Centr e (P.) Ltd. [2022] 140\ntaxmann.com 535 /92 GST 860 and conten ds that in view of the said order , the present writ petition has to be\nallowed.\n4. Sri Y .N. V ivekananda, learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax, opposed the same.\n5. The point that arises for consideration in this writ petition is:-\n\"Whether the request of the petitioner can be considered?\"\n6. POINT :-\nThe aforesaid order , dated 22-7-2022, of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reads as under:-\n\"Permission to file Special Leave Petition( s) is allowed.\nDelay condoned.\nHaving heard learne d Additional Solicitor General, learned counsel appearing for different States and\nlearned counsel appearing for different private parties and having perused the record, we are of the view\nthat it is just and proper to issue the following directions in these cases:\n1. Goods and Service Tax Network (GST N) is directed to open common portal for filing\nconcerned forms for availing Transitional Credit through TRAN-1 and TRAN-2 for two\nmonths i.e. w.e.f. 1-9-2022 to 31-10-2022.\n2. Considering the judgments of the High Courts on the then prevailin g peculiar\ncircumstances, any aggrieved registered assessee is directed to file the releva nt form or\nrevise the already filed form irrespectiv e of whether the taxpayer has filed writ petition\nbefore the High Court or whether the case of the taxpayer has been decided by Information\nTechnology Grievance Redressal Committee (ITGRC).\n3. GSTN has to ensure that there are no technical glitch during the said time.\n4. The concerned officers are given 90 days thereafter to verify the veracity of the\nclaim/transitional credit and pass appropriate orders thereon on merits after granting\nappropriate reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned.\n5. Thereafter , the allowed T ransitional credit is to be reflected in the Electronic Credit Ledger .\n6. If required GST Council may also issue appropriate guidelines to the field formations in\nscrutinizing the claims. The Special Leave Petitions are disposed of accordingly . Pending\napplications, if any , also stand disposed of.\"\n7. From  a reading of the aforesaid order , it is very clear that the assesses are given  two months' time for filing\nconcerned forms for availing Transition al Credit through TRAN-1 and TRAN- 2 i.e.., w.e.f. 1-9-2022 to 31-\n10-2022. Further , the authorities were also directed to see that there would be no technical glitches during the\nsaid perio d. A reading of the said order does not anywhere indicate that the same pertains to a particular\nassessment year. It appears that any assessee, who intends to file concerned forms for availing Transitional\nCredit through TRAN-1 and TRAN-2 and was denied earlier because of some technical problem, is always at\nliberty to make use of the said order and upload the relevant forms during the relevant period.\n8. Following the aforesaid order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in terms thereof, this Writ Petition is\nallowed to the said extent alone. There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

Learned Governme nt Pleader and learned standing counsel appearing for the respondents 1 to 3 submits\nthat against the impugned order an effective alternative remedy of appeal is provided to the appellate authority\nunder section 107 of CGST Act, and only to avoid payment of the statutory deposit of 10% of the demanded\ntax, to prefer the appeal, without availing the said effective remedy of appeal,  approached this Court on the\nground that there is gross violation of the principles of natural justice, and the grounds raised in the writ\npetition can as well be raised before the appellate authority .\n5. In view of the submissions made by learned Government Pleader and standing counsel, without going into\nmerits of the matter , this Court, in the interests of justice, felt it appropriate to dispose of the writ petition\ngiving liberty to the petitioner to approach the appellate authority provided under Section 107 of the CGST\nAct.

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner , learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes appearing\nfor respondent Nos.1, 2 and 6, Sri M.V.J.K.Kumar , learned Standing Counsel for respondent Nos.3 and 4, and\nthe learned Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing for respondent No.5. Perused the record.\n3. The averments in the affidavit filed in support of the petition show that the petitioner is a dealer in\nfertilizers and pesticides in West Godavari District. The petitioner was registered as a dealer under the\nerstwhile Andhra Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2005 (for short, \"the APVAT Act\"). After the Goods and\nServices Tax Act came into force with effect from 01.07.2017, the petitioner has taken independent\nregistration under the GST regime with GSTIN : 37AADFM6344A1ZL. The same registration number is\napplicable for both the CGST and APSGST Act, 2017. The GST regime which came into effect from\n01.07.2017 repealed a host of indirect taxes which were previously in force. Section 140 of SGST Act\nprovides for transfer of the amount of Value Added Tax Credit carried forward under the APVAT Act, 2005 to\nthe GST regime, which reads as under:\u2014\n\"140. T ransitional Arrangements for Input T ax Credit:\u2014\n(1) A registered person, other than a person opting to pay tax under section 10, shall be entitled to take, in\nhis electronic credit ledger , credit of the amount of V alue Added T ax carried forward in the return relating\nto the period ending with the day immediately preceding the appointed day, furnished by him under the\nexisting law , in such manner as may be prescribed:\nProvided that the registered person shall not be allowed to take credit in the following circumstances,\nnamely:\u2014\n(i) where the said amount of credit is not admissible as input tax credit under this Act; or\n(ii) where he has not furnished all the returns required under the existing law for the period of six\nmonths immediately preceding the appointed date; or\n(iii) where the said amount of credit relates  to goods manufactured and cleared under such exemption\nnotifications as are notified by the Government\u2026..\"\nRule 117 of the SGST Rules, 2017 was introduced to provide for the mode and manner in which such credit is\nto be carried forward. The relevant portion of the Rule reads as under:\n\"117. Tax or duty credit carried forward under any existing law or on goods held in stock on the\nappointed day:\n(1) Every registered person entitled to take credit of input tax under section 140 shall, within ninety days\nof the appointed day, submit a declara tion electronically in Form GST TRAN-1, duly signed, on the\ncommon portal specifying therein, separately , the amount of input tax credit to which he is entitled under\nthe provisions of the said section:\nProvided that the Commissioner may, on the recommendations of the Council, extend the period of\nninety days by a further period not exceeding ninety days\u2026..\"\nRule 1 17 of the SGST Rules prescribed a period of 90 days from the appointed day to file Form GST TRAN-1\nmentioning the amount of transitional input tax credit claimed by the regist ered person. The Form GST\nTRAN-1 is to be filed electronically on the common portal within the time fixed in the Rule initially or\nextended by notifications.\nThe prescribed period of 90 days from the appointed day expired on 29.09.2017 and thereafter , it was being\nextended from time to time. The claim of the petitioner is that initially , it tried to upload the details of the VAT\ncredit in Form TRAN-1 on 27.12.2017 but the same could not be uploaded due to some technical errors. As\nthe time fixed for filing the GST TRAN -1 electronically expired, the petitioner approached the authorities to\nsubmit the application manually but the authorities have not taken any action on the same.\n4. At this stage, learne d Standing Counsel would submit that the time fixed for submitting Form GST TRAN-\n1 is extended up to 31.12.2019.S.K. JAIN5. Learned counsel submits that the petitioner is not technically well versed in these aspects and unable to\nupload the forms. In support of his plea, learned counsel relied upon a judgm ent, dated 13.08.2019, of the\nDivision Bench passed by this Lantech Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  v. Pr. CIT [2019] 111 taxmann.com 144 (Ap.)  in\nwhich a similar issue came up for consideration. Relying upon the judgments in Uninav Developers Pvt Ltd.\nv.

Section 160 of the Central Goods and Services T ax Act, 2017 reads as under:-\n\"Section 160:- Assessment proceedings, etc., not to be invalid  on certain grounds:\u2014\n(1) No assessment, re-assessment, adjudication, review , revision, appeal, rectification, notice, summons\nor other proceedings done, accepted, made, issued, initiated, or purported to have been done,\naccepted, made, issued, initiated in pursuance of any of the provisions of this Act shall be invalid  or\ndeemed to be invalid  merely by reason  of any mistake, defect or omission therein, if such\nassessment, re-asses sment, adjudication, review , revision, appeal, rectification, notice, summons or\nother proceedings are in substance and effect in conformity with or accord ing to the intents,\npurposes and requirements of this Act or any existing law.\n(2) The service of any notice, order  or communication shall not be called in question, if the notice,\norder  or communication, as the case may be, has already been acted upon by the person to whom it\nis issued or where such service has not been called in question at or in the earlier proceedings\ncommenced, continued or finalised pursuant to such notice, order  or communication.\"\n6. Section 169 of the Central Goods and Services T ax Act, 2017 reads as under:\u2014\n\"Section 169:- Service of notice in certain circumstances:-\n(1) Any decision, order , summons, notice or other communication under this Act or the rules made\nthereunder shall be served by any one of the following methods, namely:\u2014\n(a) by giving or tendering it directly or by a messenger including a courier to the addressee or\nthe taxable person or to his manager or authorised representative or an advoca te or a tax\npractitioner holding authority to appear in the proceedings on behalf of the taxable person\nor to a person regularly employed by him in connection with the business, or to any adult\nmember of family residing with the taxable person; or\n(b) by registe red post or speed post or courier with acknowledgement due, to the person for\nwhom it is intended or his authorised representative, if any, at his last known place of\nbusiness or residence; or\n(c) by sending  a communication to his e-ma il address provided at the time of registration or as\namended from time to time; or\n(d) by making it available on the common portal; or\n(e) by publication in a newspaper circulatin g in the locality in which the taxable person or the\nperson to whom it is issued is last known to have resided, carried on business or personally\nworked for gain; orRITA(f) if none of the modes aforesaid is practicable, by affixing it in some conspicuous place at\nhis last known place of business or residence and if such mode is not practicable for any\nreason, then by affixing a copy thereof on the notice board of the office of the concerned\nofficer or authority who or which passed such decision or order  or issued such summ ons or\nnotice.\n(2) Every decision, order , summons, notice or any communication shall be deemed to have been served\non the date on which it is tendered or published or a copy thereof is affixed in the manner provided in\nsub-section (1).\n(3) When such decision, order , summons, notice or any communication is sent by registered post or speed\npost, it shall be deemed to have been received by the addressee at the expiry of the period normally taken\nby such post in transit unless the contrary is proved.\"\n7. On consideration of the submissions advanced and the legal provisions, we are of the view that Section 160\nof CGST Act 2017 is not attracted. An unsigned  order  cannot be covered under \"any mistake, defect or\nomission therein\" as used in Section 160. The said expression refers to any mistake, defect or omission in an\norder  with respect to assessment, re-assessment; adjudication etc and which shall not be invalid  or deeme d to\nbe invalid  by such reason, if in substance and effect the assessment, re-assessment etc is in conformity with\nthe requirements of the Act or any existing law. These would not cover omission to sign the order . Unsigned\norder  is no order  in the eyes of law. Merely uploading of the unsigned  order , may be by the Authority\ncompetent to pass the order , would, in our view , not cure the defect which goes to the very root of the matter\ni.e. validity of the order .\n8. We are of the further view that section 169 of CGST Act 2017 is also not attrac ted. Here, the question is of\nnot signing the order  and not of its service or mode of service.\n9. In the case of A. V. Bhan oji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) in W.P.No.2830 of 2023 decided on 14-2-\n2023, upon which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the petitioner (Ex.P6), a Co-ordinate Bench\nof this Court has held that the signatures  cannot be dispensed with and the provisions of sections 160 and 169\nof CGST Act would not come to the rescue.\n10. Paragraph 6 of A. V. Bhanoji Row  (supra ) is reproduced as under:-\n\"6. A reading of Section 160 of the Act makes it very much clear and candid that the safeguards\ncontained therein cannot be made applicable for the contingency in the present case. Section 169 of the\nAct, which deals with the service of notice, enables the department to make available any decision, order ,\nSummons, Notice or other communication in the common portal. In the guise of the same, the signatures\ncannot be dispensed with. In the considered opinion of this court, the aforesaid provisions of law would\nnot come to the rescue of the respondent herein, for justifying the impugned action.\"\n11. The writ petition deserves to be allowed on the first ground itself.\n12. Consequently , we are not entering into the merits of the second ground, leaving it open to the concerned\nauthority to consider , if the ground as in the impugned order , is different than the one contained in the show\ncause notice, and if it is so, it shall be open for the Authority to issue fresh notic e, if it is proposed to proceed\non such ground. However , at this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has\nsubmitted reply to the show cause notice dated 31-1-2023 and he shall also file additional reply , with respect\nto the alleged new ground as in the impugned order  of his own, within a period of four (04) weeks from today .\n13.

The petitioner has moved the Court for the following relief :\n\"\u2026\u2026\u2026. to issue an appropriate Writ, Order or Direction, more particularly in the nature of\nMANDAMUS holding that the action of the First Respondent in stopping and detaining the goods  of the\nPetitioner (8695 Kgs of MS Iron) along with Vehicle no. AP 02 T 3445, since 30-12-2021, even though\nthey are duly covered  and accompanied by Tax Invoice and E-Way Bill, without giving any reasons and\nwithout mentioning  any provision of law and not releasing the goods  so far as arbitrary , capricious,\nwithout authority or jurisdiction, abuse and misuse of official position and illegal and consequently direct\nthe First Respondent to release the said goods  along with the vehicle forthwith and pass such other order\nor orders as may be deemed fit and proper  in the circumstances of the case and in the interests of justice.\"\n3. The contention of the petitioner is that the vehicle and the scrap materials loaded on it were illegally\ndetained and kept in the custody of the authorities despite having all the legal documents  for such\ntransportation.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that on 30-12-2021 e-way bill was generated at 09:22 p.m.\nwith regard to the vehicle and the materials and on way it was stopped by the authorities at 11:33 p.m. andTARUNdetained despite them showing the tax invoice as well as the e-way bill to the authorities. Further , it was\nsubmitted that thereafter no notice was served on the authorized representative of the petitioner and still the\nauthorities have proceeded against the vehicle and the materials loaded on it without authority of law. It was\nsubmitted that the son of the proprietor of the petitioner firm had even visited the authorities on 1-1-2022 and\n2-1-2022 but due to the rude behaviour by the authorities, he had to return.\n5. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the basis of the counter -affidavit filed by him, submitted that\nincorrect statements have been advanced inasmuch as there was no occasion for the authorities to misbehave\nwith the son of the proprietor of the petitioner firm as everything was on record. It was submitted that the\nfactual position is that despite the petitioner having e-way bill and tax invoice, the same were in relation to\nonly 8695  Kgs of the iron and steel scrap, whereas upon actual verification, by getting the same weighed, it\ncame to 1025 Kgs in excess  of what was disclosed in the tax invoice and e-way bill. Thus, it was submitte d\nthat, since there is excess  quantity , the petitioner is liable to be proceeded against under the provisions of the\nAndhra Pradesh Goods  and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the 'APGST Act'). It was\nsubmitted that finally show-cause notice in the form of GST MOV -10 have been issued and served on the\npetitioner through the mode of service as contemplated under the statute, propo sing to move for confiscation\ninvoking power under section 130(1) of the APGST Act.\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that since the report with regard to weighing of the vehicle and\nthe materials thereon has been obtained behind its back, no liability can be fastened on the basis of the same.\n7. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that, in any view of the matter , since even basic facts are in\ndispute, this Court may not interfere in the matter and the petitioner should be relegated to the statutory\nauthority/forum where these matters can be well thrashed out.\n8. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties,\nthe Court being conscious of the fact that the vehicle and the materials thereon  i.e., iron and steel scrap  not\nbeing perishable and still in the custody of the departmental authorities, ends of justice would be served if, in\nthe presence of the authorized representative of the petitioner , a fresh weighing of the same is undertaken.\n9. Accordingly , let the authorized representative of the petitioner appear before the respondent no. 1 on 11-2-\n2022 i.e., day after tomorrow  at 11:00 a.m. Upon him doing so, the vehicle and the mate rials thereon shall be\ngot weighed in accordance with law. Copy of the same would also be handed over to the representative of the\npetitioner . Depending upon what comes out of the said exercise, consequences in law shall follow . The writ\npetition is, accordingly , disposed of. No order as to costs.\n10.

Learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that by invoking the provisions of section 130 of the\nCentral Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, (for short \"the Act\"), 1st respondent acted without jurisdiction.\nFurther  vide Finance Act, 2021, sections 129 and 130 were amended to the effect that \"Non- Obstente\" clause\nwas removed from section 130, while retaining the Non-Obstente clause in section 129 of the Act and that the\nsaid amen dment came into effect from 1-2-2022 and as such from the said date, section 129 of the Act shall\nhave over riding ef fect on section 130 of the Act.\n3. Further it is contended that section 129 of the Act clearly stated that the same is specific provision which\ndeals with the goods in transit. In respect of cases pertaining to goods in transit, if at all any penalty isGKleviable, the same shall be levied under section 129 of the Act. The Non-Obstente clause in section 129 of the\nAct is indicative of the legislative intent to prevent the application of any other provisions of the Act with\nrespect to goods in transit. Further learned counsel for the petitioner draws the attention of this Court with\nregard to case law of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Syner gy Fertichem (P.) Ltd v. State of Gujarat\n[2019] 112 taxmann.com 370/2020 (33) GSTL 513 (Guj.)  and also placed on record the interim order passed\nby Gujarat High Court dated 30-3-2022 in \"Shanti Metal Industries  v. State of Gujarat  [R/special Civil\nApplication No. 5933 of 2022]\".\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that this Court stayed all the proceedings and\nconsequential actions pursuant to confiscation order dated 27-4-2022, subject to condition that the petitioner\nshall depo sit 50% of the fine amount within a period of four weeks by its order , dated 26-5-2022. In view of\nthe said order , the petitioner is suffering huge financial loss and also the goods along with vehicle, which are\nunder the custody of the respondents.\n5. Further contended that this Court stayed the operation of confiscation order in Form GST MOV -11 subject\nto deposit of 50% which is much higher than the statutory amount to obtain stay against the confiscation\norder . As per terms of section 107(1 1) of the CGST Act, 2017, while filing an appeal against the confiscation\norder , there shall be a deemed stay against the said order subject to payment of 10 percent disputed tax\namount.\n6. It is furth er conten ded that if this Court releases the goods and vehicle on payment of 25% of the value\nproposed in confiscation order and a personal bond for the remaining amount, there shall be no loss to the\nGovernment exchequer and requested to modify the earlier order of this Court.\n7. Mr. Y.N.V ivekananda, learned Govern ment Pleader for the respondents vehemently opposed to allow the\napplication.\n8. On heari ng, this Court observed that both the counsels did not notice the earlier order passed by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in Matrix Traders  v. Asstt. Commissioner  [W.P.No.12843 of 2022, dated 4-5-\n2022] though it was annexed in the application. The said order is squarely applicable to the issue involved in\nthis writ petition and that learned counsel for the petitioner requested to modify  the order of this Court dated\n26-5-2022 in terms of order passed by the Division Bench in W .P.No.12843 of 2022, dated 4-5-2022.\n9.

The petitioner herein is a Private Limit ed Company registered under the Companies Act, 2013. It has two\nsister concerns namely (1) Santhosh imatha Oil Packaging Industries situated at Kakinada and (2)\nSanthoshimatha Oils and Fats Private Limited, Nellore. The 2nd respondent authorized the 1st respondent to\ninspect the business premises of the petitioner and to verify whether the petitioner has conducted business in\naccordance with the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short \"GST Act\"). It is stated\nthat the petitioner participated in the inspection conducted on 25-11-2020 and produced all books of account.\nThe 1st respondent also collected all the necessary material, namely , weigh-bridge reports, sale order books,\nstock registers, raw material purchases etc. The first respondent recovered a book containing details of orders\nplaced by various brokers. According to the first respondent, there are some variations in the details contained\ntherein with regard to sale of palmolei n oil and palm fatty acid, distributed to various dealers from their\nrefinery located at Kakinada as well as its related companies. On verification of sale details, no transactions\nare found in the sales registers. Hence, the first respondent assumed that the petitioner has suppressed the\nturnover .\n4. The first show-cause notice was issued on 26-4-2021 calling upon the petitioner to clear the full amount as\nmentioned therein, by 25-5-2021. The petitioner gave a detailed reply dated 22-5-2021 enclosed several\ndocuments in support of his contention. Since the petitioner , who is assessee, disputed the issues raised in\nDRC-01A, DRC 01, dated 29-9-2021 came to be issued by the respondents. It is said that this notice is issued\nbased on authorization for assessment under section 74(1) of the Act issued by the second respondent on 21-8-\n2021. The first respondent while dealing with the issues raised in DRC-01A and the reply filed by the\npetitioner , partly accepted and partly disagreed the submissions made by the petitioner .\n5. The tax liability proposed for all the three years put together was Rs.14,96,92,177/- under IGST ,\nRs.7,23,99,139/- under CGST and Rs.7,23,99,139/- under SGST . The petitioner was called upon either to\ndischar ge the total tax under section 74 with interest under section 50 and penalty under section 74(8) on or\nbefore 18-10-2021 or to file objections and to avail personal hearing by the said date. As the petitioner\ndecided to contest the show-cause notice, he gave reply dated 27-10-2021. The petitioner was present before\nthe first respondent for personal hearing on 02-11-2021, at which point of time, he reiterated his contentions\nand also submitted that the seized material have to be returned in original since  the Photostat copies were not\nlegible. Accordingly , the first respondent is said to have returned the order confirmation books and other\nrecords filed at the time of inspection on 15-1 1-2021.\n6. On 16-11-2021, the first respondent through e-mail dated 16-11-2021, called upon the petitioner to file\nspecific objections on or before 22-11-2021 and ultimately a comprehensive reply was said to have been filed\nby the petitioner on 08-12-2021. The issue was with regard to alleged non-payment of tax on ocean freight.\nThe petitioner claims that he has already paid an amount of Rs.60,73,106/- and Rs.94,46,893/- under IGST on\nocean freight on actuals under reserve charge for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. In support of his claim, the\npetitioner enclosed challans.\n7. Therefore, the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.18525 of 2019, questioning the levy of IGST on ocean-\nfreight by challenging the Notification Nos.10/2017-Integrated Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017 and 8/2017-\nIntegrated Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017 respectively as unconstitutional. By its order dated 20-11-2019, this\nCourt directed the respondents not to take any coercive steps for recovery of tax on ocean-freight.\n8. While things stood thus, the proceeding s dated 10-2-2022 came to be issued levying ocean freight though it\nwas menti oned in Form DRC-07 that the demand is not pressed. Learned Senior Counsel would submit that\nwhen there is an order of this Court staying collection of penalty or tax on ocean freight, the authorities ought\nnot to have demanded for payment of ocean freight known fully well about the same. He further submits that\nthe proceedings clearly indicate that there was no personal hearing at the time of passing the impugned order .\n9. Learned Government Pleader for Comm ercial Taxes would submit that the argument of the learned senior\ncounsel that there was no personal hearing may not be correct as objections filed were taken into\nconsideration at the time of passing of the order . The ocean freight alleged to have been paid is given credit\nand that no loss is caused to the petition er. However , learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would contend\nthat in view of the notices issued there  is every possibility of collecting ocean freight inspite of the order\npassed by this Court staying the same.\n10. Having regard to the above, the impugned proceedings in DRC-07 dated 10-2-2022 is set aside and the\nmatter is remanded back to the first respondent, who shall deal with the same and pass appropriate orders after\ngiving an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner , in accordance with law .KAR TIK11. With the above directions, the W rit Petition is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.\nConsequently , miscellaneous petitions pending, if any in this writ petition, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J.- The challenge in this writ petition is to the order in Appeal No.06/2023(G) GST,\ndated 30.06.2023 passed by the Addit ional Commissioner of Central Tax (GST-Appeals)/1st respondent,\nrejecting the appeal filed by the petitioner challenging the assessment order O.C.No.120/2022-2023, dated\n20.07.2022, passed by the 2nd responden t, on the ground that the appeal was filed with a delay beyond the\ncondonable period.\n2. Heard learned coun sel for petitioner , Sri C.Sanjeeva Rao and Smt.Shanthi Chandra, learned Jr.Standing\nCounsel for CBIC for the respondents 1 to 3 and learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 4th respondent.\n3. As can be seen, the 1st respondent observed that the assessment order was passed on 20.07.2022 by the 2nd\nrespondent and the appeal was filed online on 26.09.2022 but the physical copies of the appeal were received\nby the office of the 1st respondent only on 24.04.2023 and since the appeal in all respects ought to have been\nfiled by 19.10.2022 and as such, there was a delay of about six months five days in between 26.09.2022 and\n24.04.2023, which is beyond the condon able period under Section 107 of CGST Act and accordingly , rejected\nthe appeal.\n4. Learned counsel for petitioner would submit that admittedly the appeal was filed on 26.09.2022 online\nmentioning therein the particulars of the assessment order dated 20.07.2022, as the said assessment order was\nalready uploaded by the Department on the official website and therefore, he mentioned the particulars of the\nsaid order . To that effect, learned counsel filed a copy of the screen shot showin g the date of assessment order\nas 20.07.2022 and Order No.OIO No.01/2022-23-GST . Learned counsel would thus submit that the petitionerRITA ROYhas compl ied with the requirement of filing the appeal online and the copy of the order . He would further\nsubmit that the petitioner filed the physical copies of appeal along with the required documents on\n24.04.2023. Taking the said date, the 1st responden t held that the appeal was beyond the condonable period.\nLearned counsel for petitioner would further submit that as per Rule 108, appeal could be filed either\nelectronically or otherwise and since the petitioner has filed the appeal electronically on 26.09.2022 and made\na referenc e with regard to the impugn ed assessment order also therein, the 1st respondent ought to have\nconsidered the same and held that the appeal was filed well within time. Howev er, taking the date of filing of\nthe physical copies i.e., 24.04.2023, appeal was rejected holding that it was beyond the condonable period\nwhich is unjust.\n5. Learned Jr.Standing Counsel for respondents 1 to 3 would submit that though the petitioner filed the appeal\nonline on 26.09.202, however , following the mandate of filing certified copy , he has not produced an online\ncertified copy . However , he only mentioned the date of assessment order therein and thereby , has not fulfilled\nthe conditions. He filed the physical copies of appeal and the assessment order copy only on 24.04.2023\nwhich was far beyond the condonable period and therefore, the 1st respondent has rightly rejected the appeal.\n6. We heard the above respective contentions of both the learned counsel.\n7. The point for consideration is 'Whether the impugned rejection order is sustainable in the eye of law?'.\n8. Admittedly , in this matter , the assessment order was passed on 20.07.2022 and the same was uploaded on\nthe official website on the same date. It is a further admitted fact that the petitioner filed the appeal\nelectronically on 26.09.2022, which was within the 90 days as prescribed under Section 107(1) of CGST Act.\nNow the bone of contention is with regard to the uploading of the certified copy. According to the petitioner ,\nsince the assessment order was already hoisted on department website, he made a reference of the order\nnumber with OIO No.01/2022-23-GST and with order No.3CEEYK0402S07220015, dated 20.07.2022 and\nthus, substantially complied with the requirement.\n9. On perusa l of the copy of the screen shot filed along with the material papers, we find some force in the\nsubmission of learned counsel. Since admittedly the copy of the assessment order dated 20.07.2022 was\nalready placed on the department websi te, the petitioner gave the reference of the said order while filing the\nappeal electronically . Therefore, we find force in the submission that the requirement was substantially met.\nTherefore, the 1st respondent ought to have taken the date of filing of the appeal as 26.09.2022 for all practical\npurposes. However , the 1st responden t took the date of filing as 24.04.2023, as on the date the appeal was\nfiled along  with the documents physical ly. In our considered view , this approach of the 1st respondent cannot\nbe accepte d. Electro nical filing of the appeal is a facilitation given to the assesse es. That being so, the copy of\nthe impugned order which was already available on the web can be mentioned for easy reference.\n10. Accordingly , this writ petition is allowe d and the appeal filed by the petitioner in electronic mode is held\nas well within time and the matter is remitted back to the 1st respondent to register the appeal and decide the\nsame in accordance with the governing law and rules expeditiously . No costs.\n11. As a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The challenge in this writ petition is to the proceedings dated 10-11-2022  vide\nreference No. ZD370922009810G under section 74(5) of APGST Act, 2017 directing the petitioner to pay Rs.\n56,95,19,461/- towards dif ferential tax, interest and penalty for evasion of the due tax as illegal and arbitrary .\n2. Petitioner's case briefly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a proprietary concern engaged in outsourcing employees to A.P. State Beverages\nCorporation/4th respondent and A.P. Mineral Development Corporation/5th respondent in various\ncategories. The petitioner obtained GST registration and has been filing monthly returns as\nstipulated in GSTR 3B and paying the tax.\n(b) Petitioner entered into agreements with respondents 4 and 5 to outsource the employees of variouscategories. In addition to the remunerat ion towards wages, the contractee has inter alia agreed to\npay the specified amounts as contributio n towards EPF, ESI in terms of G.O.Ms.No.151 (Fin-HR-I)\nPlanning & Policy , dated 8-8-2016. In addition to above mandatory payment,  the contractee has\nagreed to pay service char ges to the petitioner @ 2.17%.\n(c) As per Section 9 of the APGST Act, the petitioner is liable to pay GST on receipt of the service\ncharges alone. The petitioner is no way concerned with any other payment. The petitioner collects\nEPF and ESI from the Government and pays to the respective authorities. While so, the dispute is\non account of Form GST DRC-01A which was issued under section 74(5) of APGST Act as per\nwhich, the GST was calculated on the entire value or payment received by the petitioner , though the\nliability of the petitioner under GST law is only on the service charges being paid and received by\nthe petitioner .\n(d) The petitioner is only an agent of respo ndents 4 and 5 for outsourcing of manpower for which, as\nan agent, the petitio ner gets service charges at an agreed percentage. Hence the 3rd respondent has\nno legal foundation to impose tax, interest and penalty U/s 74(5) of the APGST Act. The impugned\norder is shorn of details. The petitioner has submitted a representation dated 19-9-2022 stating that\ntaxable value reported in GSTR-3B returns relate to the service charges paid to her and over and\nabove the said service char ges, there is no tax liability under APGST Act, 2017.\n(e) The 3rd respondent issued show cause notice along with the statement of dues in DRC-01 on 23-9-\n2022, for which the petitioner submitte d response dated 22-10-2022 contending that the levy of\nGST for provision of services may be restricted only to the consideration for the services provided\nand payments made to the employees outsourced to respondents 4 and 5 towards wages, ESI and\nEPF shall not form  part of taxable turnover . However , the 3rd responden t passed impugned\nAssessment Order . Hence the writ petition.\n3. Briefly the averments in the counter filed by 3rd respondent are thus:\n(a) Admittedly , the petitioner is engaged in the business of Man power supply services to respondents 4\n& 5 and others. The 3rd respondent passed the Assessment Order dated 10-11-2022 under section\n74 of the APGST Act, 2017 levying tax of Rs. 23,79,26,090/-, penalty equal to tax, and interest of\nRs. 5,36,10,496/- which is being impugned in the present writ petition. The contention of the\npetitioner that the 3rd respondent levied tax on amounts received by the petitioner other than\nservice charges and imposed interest and penalty equivalent to the tax without any legal foundation\nis incorrect.\n(b) The petiti oner is a registered tax paye r vide GSTN 37AKAPM1969NIZM and filed stipulated\nmonthly returns in GSTR 3B reporting  therein the taxable value and paying tax accordingly . The\npetitioner entered into agreement with the respondents 4 and 5 for providing services of outsourcing\nof employ ees in various categories and admittedly he is receiving total amount including service\ncharges, EPF, ESI as per the guidelines laid down in G.O.Ms.No.151 dated 8-8-2016. However , the\nsaid G.O. has nothing to do with the GST payable by the petitioner for computation of taxable\nvalue of the supply . In this regard, the contention of the petitioner that under section 9 of the\nAPGST Act, the GST is limited to the service charges alone received by the petitioner and the\namounts received towards EPF, ESI etc. cannot be included is not correct. On the other hand, as per\nSection 15(2) of the AGPST Act, 2017, the value of supply includes taxes, duties, cesses, fees and\ncharges levied under any law for the time being in force other than the APGST Act, 2017 and\nCGST Act. Further , as per Section 2(31), the term \"consideration\" in relation to the supply of goods\nor services  or both includes, any payment made or to be made whether in money or otherwise, in\nrespect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of goods or servic es or both, whether\nby a recipient or by any other person but shall not include any subsidy given by the Central or State\nGovernment. In view of above legal position, the payment received for supply  of taxable service\nshall be treated as \"consideration\" and GST shall be charged on the total consid eration. The above\nprovisions do not specifically mention that the GST shall be charged on service charges alone. The\npayment of employee's or employer's share in EPF and ESI is a statutory obligation cast upon the\npetitioner under the EPF Act and ESI Act, but such liability will not have any bearing on the\ncomputation of taxable supply under the APGST Act.\n(c) In addition to above, a perusal of invoices raised by the petitioner shows that the petitioner hascharged GST on the total value of the supply and has not restricted the GST to his services charge\nportion alone.\n(d) The contention of the petitioner that the tax liability plus interest and penalty were fixed without\nany legal foundation is baseless. The Adjudicating Authority issued intimation of tax liability in\nDRC  01A on 29-7-2022 and show cause notice in DRC  01 was issued on 23-9-2022 fixing personal\nhearing dates on 2-9-2022 and 6-10-2022. Thus, the Adjudicating Authority  has followed due\nprocedure as contemplated under the provisions of the Act and principles of natural justice while\nfinalizing the orders in DRC  07. The vast difference between turnover reported in GSTR 3B and\nturnover assessed in DRC  07 was due to the turnovers adopted for assessment as per books of\naccounts maintained by the petitioner and information received from respective departments. The\nvariation in taxable turnovers was tabulated month-wise in DRC  01 itself. Hence, the contention\nthat there was no legal foundation for fixation of the tax liability is not correct.\n(e) The contention of the petitioner that the wages provided to the employees and statutory payments\nof EPF and ESI, etc., will not fall within the ambit of the GST is not correct. In the context of the\nAPGST Act, 2017, the petitioner is the service provider and the recipients are the Government\ncorporations and as such there is no employer and employee relation between the petitioner and\nrespective corporations. The salaries, wages are being provided by the petitioner herself and EPF,\nESI etc are also paid by her. The supply being taxed is supply of manpow er services by the\npetitioner to various corporations. In the course of providing the services, the petitioner may incur\nvarious expenditure s like salaries and other related obligations. However , the supply made by the\npetitioner does not fall under the ambit of employee-employer relationshi p as mentioned in\nSchedule III of the Act and is not eligible for any exemption.\n(f) The petitioner has raised invoices to the service recipients and charged full tax @ 18% GST on\neach invoice. The contention of the petitioner that they have reported gross considerations\ninadvertently in GSTR 1 is not correct. On the other hand, it shows the understanding of the\npetitioner that the total consideration received is liable to GST, as the short payment of tax was\ndetermined as per the provisions of Section 74. The said provision carries with it the applicable\npenalty and interest. Accordingly , the tax penalty and interest are proposed and are confirmed by\nfollowing due procedure. The petitioner while charging GST @ 18% on total invoice value, but at\nthe same time paying tax on lesser value only to the extent of service charges is a clear violation of\nthe law leading to unjust enrichment and therefore, the petitioner cannot turn round and claim that\nthe impugned order is illegal. Hence, the writ petition may be dismissed.\n4. Hear d arguments of learned Senior Counsel Sri M.V.K. Murthy representing Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar , learned\ncounsel for the petitioner and learned Government Pleader for Commerc ial Taxes-I representing 3rd\nrespondent.\n5. Learned Senior Counsel Sri M.V.K. Murthy , argued at length that the componen ts i.e., wages, ESI and EPF,\nwill not form part of the value of the taxable supply of the services for the reaso n, the wages were paid to the\nrespective employee s and the amounts were paid towards ESI and EPF to dischar ge the statutory obligation\nand the petitioner has not retained those amounts with her and therefore they do not form part of the\nconsideration received by the petitioner for the services rendered to the recipients i.e., responden ts 4 and 5. He\nwould vehemently argue that the net service charges collected by the petitioner alone form part of the\nconsideration which  is exigeble to GST. He would also argue that since the petitioner is an agent on behalf of\nrespondents 4 and 5, the amounts covered by wages, ESI and EPF were paid by the petitioner as an agent of\nrespondents 4 and 5 and hence those amounts cannot be added to the service charges received by the\npetitioner . Learned senior counsel would strenuously ar gue that in the reply dated 22-10-2022 submitted to the\nshow cause notice the petitioner has clearly raised the above objection and contended that the authority has no\nlegal sanctity to assess the petitioner to tax. However , the 3rd respondent witho ut considering the objections\nof the petitioner in a right perspective and without affording an opportunity of hearing, passed the impugned\norder . Learned counsel would submit that the petitioner is an old lady aged 75 years and she could not respond\nimmediately through  her authorized representative to submit arguments on behalf of the petitioner . Learned\ncounsel thus prayed  to set aside the impug ned order dated 10-11-2022 and remit the matter to the 3rd\nrespondent to hear the petitioner's objections and pass appropriate order afresh.\n6. Per contra , learned Government Pleader while opposing the writ petition would firstly contend that the writ\npetition is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed in limini as the petitioner has efficacious and alternativeremedy to file appeal against the impugned Assessment Order . Nextly , he argued that as per Section 15(2) of\nA.P.G.S.T . Act, the components like wages, statutory taxes etc., shall form part of value of taxable supply and\ntherefore it is preposterous for the petitioner to contend that only the net amount i.e., Service Char ges paid to\nthe petitio ner alone is liable for GST. Learned Government Pleader vehemently argued that in fact the\npetitioner has collected GST on the total amount received by her from respondents 4 and 5, which is evident\nfrom the explanation dated 22-10-2022 submitted by her. However , she paid the GST only on the net Service\nChar ges received by her by retaining major portion of the GST collected from respondents 4 and 5. Hence the\npetitioner is guilty of undue and enrichment. In that view , the writ petition is not maintainable. He further\nargued that petitioner cannot contend that she is a mere agent of respondents 4 and 5 and that the wages, EPF,\nESI etc., were paid by her to their employees on their behalf and therefore those amounts cannot be taken into\nconsideration to compute the value of taxable supply . Conversely he would argue that there is no employer\nemployee relationship between respondents 4 and 5 on one hand and petitioner and her manpower . He would\nemphasise that it is a case of pure supply of services of manpower by the petitio ner on receiving the monitory\nconsideration. Therefore, the entire value of the services shall be treated as a taxable supply . It is altogether a\ndifferent aspect that, from out of the consideration received by the petitioner , she has to meet the expenses like\nwages, statutory deductions like ESI and EPF . He thus prayed to dismiss the petition.\n7. The point for consideration is, whether there are merits in the W rit Petition to allow?\n8. POINT : We gave our anxious consideration to the above respective submissions. Admittedly the 3rd\nrespondent issued show cause notice dated 23-9-2022 U/s 74(1) of A.P.G.S.T . Act, 2017 fixing the tax due\nwith interest and penalty of Rs. 52,48,58 ,430/- and instructed the petitioner to submit reply within 15 days of\nreceipt of notice. It is a further admitted fact that, as against the show cause notice, the petitioner filed her\nobjections dated 22-10-2022 contending that GST is taxable only on the Services to recipients but not on the\nESI, EPF and wages etc. In the said objections, the petitioner also mentioned that the earlier letter submitted\nby her on 19-9-202 2 may be treated as withdrawn. Now the grievance of the petitioner is that without\nconsidering the objections dated 22-10-2022 and without providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner ,\nthe 3rd respondent passed the impugned  Assessment Order dated 10-11-2022 fixing the tax liability , thereby ,\nthe petitio ner who is an old aged lady of 75 years lost her valuable opportunity to put forth her case. The\nrespondent denied the aforesaid conten tion and argued that due opportunity was given to the petitioner and\nthereafter only the impugned order was passed.\n9. In this context, we perused the impugn ed order dated 10-11-2022, wherein it is mentioned, as against the\nshow cause notice dated 23-9-2022, the petitioner submitted a letter of objection  dated 22-10-2022 raising her\nobjection that the tax proposed on the wages, ESI and EPF etc., should be exclu ded from the taxable turnover .\nIn the impugned order, it is further stated that the objection of the petitioner cannot be considered in view of\nSection 15(2) of A.P.G.S.T . Act, 2017. It is further mentioned that the petitioner was provided opportunity of\nhearing on 6-10-202 2, 11-10-2022, 24-10-2022 and 9-12-2022. For the notice date 1-11-2022, the petitioner\nfiled a letter seeking  one week time to attend due her ill health. Again in respect of the scheduled hearing\ndated 24-10-2022, the petitioner filed a letter dated 22-10-2022. Subsequently also the petitioner filed a letter\nstating that due to ill health she was unable to attend personally and that she filed a Writ Petition before the\nHigh Court of Andhra Pradesh questioni ng the best judgment orders passed by the Jurisdictional Authority for\nthe tax period from May 2021 to September 2021. Thereupon, as per the communication received from the\nJoint Com missioner (ST) Vijayawada-II  Division, leaving the tax period of May 2021 to September 2021, the\nassessment is confined under the present impugned order for the remaining period i.e., April 2021 and from\nOctober 2021 to March 2022. Accordingly , the impugned Assessment Order was passed fixing a total tax\nliability including interest and penalty at Rs. 56,95,19,461/-.\n10. In our considered view , no doubt the 3rd respondent has extended some opportunity to the petitioner for\npersonal hearing. However , the fact remains that the petitioner could not avail the said opportunity in view of\nher old age as she being aged 75 years and also due to her ill health. Having regard to a high tax amount plus\ninterest and penalty proposed to be laid and nature of the contention raise d by the petitioner , the 3rd\nrespondent ought to have extended some more opportunity to the petitioner for personal hearing. Therefore,\nwithout going into the merits of petitioner's case, we are of the considered opinion that a direction shall be\nissued to the 3rd respondent to afford a personal hearing to the petitioner and pass Assessment Order afresh in\naccordance with law on suitable terms.\n11. Accordingly , without reference to the merits of the petitioner's case, the impugned Assessment Order\ndated 10-11-2022 passed by the 3rd respondent is set aside on the condition of petitioner depositing  50% of\ntax component of Rs. 23,79,26,090/- as mentioned in the impugned order dated 10-11-2022 within six (6)KAR TIKweeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and upon such deposit, the 3rd respondent shall fix a\ndate for personal hearing of the petitioner with regard to her objections to the proposed assessment and after\nhearing the petitioner , pass an appropria te Assessment Order in accordance with the governing law and rules\nexpeditiously . In case, the petitioner fails to make the deposit as mentioned  supra , this order shall be deemed\ncancel.\nAccordingly , this W rit Petition is disposed of. No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*Partly in favour of assessee."}

Hence, department officials informed\nto the dealers that when wet tamarind and other goods are purchased from farmers and transported, the\ncommodity should be accompanied with photo copies of Aadhaar card of the farmers from whom they\npurchased and on the left side top, the details like Code, GSTIN, PAN, Name, Trade Name, Weight, rate,\netc., of the purchasing dealer should be mentioned.\u25a0 During the course of business, the petitioner purchased 2515 Kgs and 5790 Kgs of wet tamarind from the\nfarmers in the State of Karnataka for Rs. 3.32 lakh by obtaining photo copies of Aadhaar cards of\naforesaid two farme rs and mentioning all the details and transported in his vehicle to his business place in\nPunganur .\n\u25a0 During the transit, the respondent intercepted the vehicle and issued notice of detention under section 129\non the ground that the driver failed to produce relevant documents i.e., tax invoice and delivery challan,\nwhich were mandatory under GST Act. Though petitioner informed to the respondent that as per\ninstructions in the meeting, he obtained  Aadhaar cards of the farmers containing necessary details, the\nrespondent did not heed and refused to release the goods unless the petitioner deposited Rs. 5,15,000\ntowards tax as well as penalty . Respondent informed that the petitioner could make his submis sion during\nthe course of assessment proceedings. As the tamarind is prone for speedy deterioration, having no other\ngo, the petitioner deposited said amount and got the commodity released on the understanding that the\npetitioner would have an opportunity to put forth his objections during the assessment proceedings\npromised to be taken up later .\n\u25a0 The respo ndent did not initiate any assessment or penalty or confiscation proceedings against the\npetitioner . As per section 67(7) where any goods are seized and no notice thereof was given within six\nmonths, the goods was to be returned to the person from whose possession they were seized.\n\u25a0 However , according to petitioner though more than one year passed since seizure of goods, no notice for\nmaking any assessm ent or penalty or confiscation was issued by the responde nts. Hence, the petitioner\nsubmitted an application seeking refund of amount deposited by it. However , the Competent Authority\nrejected the refund application stating that the refund amount relates to confiscation proceedings invoked\nunder section 130 Petitioner contende d that no proceedings under section 130 were initiated by the\nrespondent and except notice of deten tion under section 129, no further notice was issued nor other\nproceedings were initiated by the respondent.\n\u25a0 On contrary , respondent filed show cause notice said to be issued by him to the petitioner informing that\nfor the reasons stated  in the said notice, he proposed to confiscate the goods by invoking the powers under\nsection 68 read with rule 138. It was also mentioned that the objections if any on the aforesaid proposal\ncan be filed with the documentary proofs within seven days from the date of receipt of the notice, failing\nwhich the orders will be passed. The case of the respondent was that after issua nce of the said notice, the\npetitioner voluntarily  confessed his guilt as he had no documents for transport of the taxable goods and so\nexecuted confession  letter , basing on which, the respondent initiated proceedings and after payment of the\nstipulated amount, a release order of even date was also passed.

If issuance of the show-cause\nnotice and passing of the proceedings consequent upon the admission of the guilt of the petitioner are true,\nthe respondents can be said to have followed the procedure contemplated under section 130. The question\nis whether the show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner . The petitioner's explanation in his reply is\nthat he did not receive the show-cause notice and did not execute the confession letter dated 12-3-2018.\nHis furthe r explana tion is that the respondent authorities obtained his signatures along with stamp on\nblank papers and thereafter created the show cause notice and confession letter .

It is only after the\nrespondents filed their counter and enclosed the show-cause notice and other documents, then in the reply\naffidavit the petition er for the first time took such plea. Hence, the contention of the petitioner does not\nmerit consideration.

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner seeks writ of mandamus  declaring the action of the 1st respondent\nin detaining the wet tamarind of the petitioner while transporting the same from the Karnataka State after\npurchase to the petitioner's business place at Punganur in Chittoor District through vehicle bearing No. KA01\nAC8239, by issuing notice of detention dated 11-3-2018 and collecting Rs. 5,15,000/- i.e., Rs. 32,500/- as tax;\nRs. 32,500/- as penalty and Rs. 4,50,000/- under other head as a condition for release of the commodity\nwithout conducting any assessment or penalty proceedings and instead, issuing impugned \"summary of order\"\ndated 2-12-2019 by treating the detention notice as assessment order , as contrary and violative of principles of\nnatural justice and for a consequential relief of refunding the amount of Rs. 5,15,000/- after deducting the tax\nof Rs. 32,500/-.\n2. Petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a registered dealer under  GST Act doing business in fresh/wet tamarind etc., by\npurchasing them from farmers/agriculturists and bringing to his business premises at Punganur and\nselling the same. Tamarind is enumerated in Entry No. 57 of Schedule-I to the GST Act, 2017 with\nTariff Item No. 0810 and is exempted from tax.\n(b) After GST  Act came into force on 1-7-2017, the GST officials held meetin gs with dealers to\nfamiliarize them with procedure to be followed under GST regime. The farmers, who sell wet\ntamarind being not registered dealers, cannot issue tax invoices and delivery challans. Hence,\ndepartment officials informed to the dealers that when wet tamarind and other goods are purchased\nfrom farmers and transported, the commodity should be accompanied with photo copies of Aadhaar\ncard of the farmers from whom they purchased and on the left side top, the details like Code,\nGSTIN, P AN, Name, T rade Name, W eight, rate, etc., of the purchasing dealer should be mentioned.\n(c) While so, during the course of business, the petitioner purchased 2515 Kgs and 5790 Kgs of wet\ntamarind from the farmers  viz., B. Govinda and B. Kancheppa in the State of Karnataka for Rs.\n3,32,250/- i.e, @ Rs. 40/- per K.g by obtaining photo copies of Aadhaar cards of aforesaid two\nfarmers and mentioning all the details as stated  supra  and transported in his vehicle bearing No.\nKA01 AC8239 to his business place in Punganur .\n(d) During the transit, the 1st respondent  intercepted the vehicle and issued impugned notice of\ndetention under section 129 of A.P GST Act, 2017, dated 11-3-2018 on the ground that the driver\nfailed to produce relevant documents i.e., tax invoice and delivery challan, which are mandatory\nunder the AP GST Act, 2017. Though petitioner informed to the 1st respondent that as per\ninstructions in the meeting, he obtained Aadhaar cards of the farmers containing necessary details,\nthe 1st respondent did not heed and refused to release the goods unless the petitioner deposited Rs.\n5,15,000/- i.e., Rs. 35,250 towards tax; Rs. 32,500/-t owards penalty and Rs. 4,50,000/- towards\n\"others\". He informed that the petitioner can make his submission during the course of assessment\nproceedings. As the tamarind is prone for speedy deterioration, having no other go, the petitioner\ndeposited Rs. 5,15,000/- on 14-3-2018 and got the commodity released on the understanding that\nthe petitioner would have an opportunity to put forth his objections during the assessment\nproceedings promised to be taken up later .\n(e) However , subsequen tly the 1st respondent did not initiate any assessment or penalty or confiscation\nproceedings against the petitioner . As per section 67(7) of AP GST Act, 2017, where any goods are\nseized and no notice thereof is given within six months, the goods shall be returned to the person\nfrom whose possession they were seized.\n(f) However , though more than one year passed since seizure of goods, no notice for making any\nassessment or penalty or confiscation was issued by the respondents. Hence, the petitioner\nsubmitted an application for refund dated 17-11-2019 to the 2nd respondent  seeking refund of\namount deposited by it. However , the 2nd respondent rejected the refund application stating that the\nrefund amount relates to confiscation  proceedings invoked under section 130 of SGST Act.\nPetitioner contends that no proceedings under section 130 were passed by the 1st respondent andexcept notice of detention under sectio n 129, no further notice was issued nor other proceedings\nwere initiated by the 1st respondent.\n(g) Subsequently , the 1st respondent issued impugned \"summary of the order\" dated 12-12-2019 in\nForm GST DRC-07 showing the details of the payment  viz., tax Rs. 16,250/-; penalty Rs. 16,250/-\nand Rs. 4,50,000/- for \"others\" i.e., the amou nt collecte d for release of the goods. Thus, without\nissuing opportunity  of hearing and without passing assessment order or penalty order or\nconfiscation order under the relevant provisions, the 1st respondent has treated the detention notice\ndated 1 1-3-2018 as assessment order plus penalty without specifying any provision of the law .\nHence, the writ petition.\n3. The 1st respondent filed counter opposing the writ petition inter alia  contending thus:\n(a) As against the impugned order appeal lay before Appellate Joint Commissioner (ST) under section\n107 of the GST Act, 2017 and therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable. Nextly , it is\ncontended that the Inspecting Authority intercepted the petitioner's vehicle bearing No. KA01\nAC8239 on 11-3-2018 at 09:45 AM at Madanapalli Circle while carrying 8195 Kgs of flower\ntamarind from Harapanahalli, Karnataka  to Punganur and the in-char ge of conv eyance/driver failed\nto submit any documents prescribed under section 68 r/w 138 of the GST Act, 2017 and Section 20\nof IGST Act, 2017 for carrying the taxable goods. He only furnished two weightment slips bearing\nserial number 10014, dated 10-3-2018 and except that he did not produce any other documents. He\ndisclosed the particu lars of the consignee as M/s TMB Traders, Punganuru. He did not produce any\ndocuments like Aadhaar card containing the particulars as alleged by the petitioner .\n(b) Having suspected the weight of the commodity , the Inspecting Authority got weighed it again by\nM/s Vikram Electronic Weigh Bridge, Near Gangamagudi, Punganur Road, Madanapalli and found\nthat the total flower tamarind under transport was 8195 Kgs. The driver failed to produce the details\nof consign ers. As there was no need to go for further enquiry as the goods are taxable, transported\nwithout any records, a show cause notice was issued on 11-3-2018 duly providing an opportunity to\nfile written objections as well as to avail personal hearing. The said show cause notice was issued to\nthe petitio ner and the same was received on his own handwriting and seal. The petitioner himself\nfiled consent letter dated 12-3-2018 duly admitting offences on his own and made payment as\nproposed in show cause notice but did not file any objections. Thereupon the orders were passed on\n14-3-2018 which were served on petitio ner. The petitioner made an application  for refund of cash\npayment contrary to Section 54(1) of the GST Act, 2017. Hence, the refund application was\nrejected.\n(c) The petiti oner was carrying flower tamarind which is in the final stage and can be directly\nconsumed in food items. The flower tamarind falls under Entry No. 0813 of Schedule-IV appended\nto GST but not under item 57 with tarif f No. 0810 to claim exemption.\n(d) It is no where prescribed that the registered dealers can purchase tamarind from ryots with the aid\nof Aadhaa r cards and same is contrary  to the interest of revenue and provisions of the Act and\nRules. Even if registered person purchases taxable goods from unregistere d persons they are\nsupposed to issue tax invoices in accordance with provisions of the GST Act, 2017. The petitioner\nfailed to produce the invoices.\n(e) The petitioner got released all the goods proposed for confiscation upon payment of the fine, tax\nand penalty by avail ing the option afforded under section 130(2) and (3) of the GST Act, 2017. An\nopportunity to file written objections and personal hearing was given to the petitioner but he did not\navail. In the instant case proceedings under section 129 and 130 of GST Act, 2017 are applied but\nnot under section 67(7) of the GST Act. Refund claim of the petitioner does not come under the\nprovisions of Section 54 of GST Act, 2017 and hence rejected. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ\npetition.\n4. The petitioner filed reply affidavit denying the counter allegations. While reiterating the plea that at the\ntime of interception of the vehicle no show cause notice was issued to the petitioner , it is further pleaded that\nthe alleged show cause notice filed by the 1st respondent was prepared later after obtaining the signature and\nstamp of the petition er on blank paper . The petitioner denied that he filed conse nt letter dated 12-3-2018 dulyadmitting offences. The detained good s were fresh/wet tamarind but not flower tamarind as alleged. He\ndenied other counter allegations.\n5. Heard Sri G. Narendra Chetty , learned counsel for petitioner and Government Pleader for Commercial\nTaxes representing respondents.\n6. The main plank of argument of learned counsel for petitioner Sri G. Narendra Chetty is that the petitioner's\nvehicle was intercepted by the 1st respondent on 11-3-2018 and detained by issuing a notice of detention\nunder section 129 of A.P GST Act, 2017 on the ground that the petitioner's driver failed to produce relevant\ndocuments. Learned counsel pointed out that at that time the 1st respondent did not contemplate to confiscate\nthe comm odity unde r section 130 of AP GST Act and no notice was issued to that effect. Be that it may, the\npetitioner explained that the commodity was wet tamarind and it was procured from the farmers of Karnataka\nand as they are not regular registered dealers, following instructions given in the meeting held by GST\nAuthorities, the Photostat copies of the Aadhaar cards of the farmers containing the particulars of the\nconsignee were obtained. In spite of producing those copies of Aadhaar cards, the 1st respondent did not\nrelease the commodity and vehicle and insisted for regular invoices. Learned counsel further argued that as\nthe 1st respondent was insisting the invoices and refusing to release the stock which was a perishable\ncommodity , in such unavoidable circumstances, the petitioner had to deposit Rs. 5,15,000/- i.e., Rs. 32,500/-\ntowards tax; Rs. 32,500/- towards penalty and Rs. 4,50,000/- towards \"others\". The said amount was arrived\nat by the authorities  taking the value of the goods @ Rs. 6,50,000/-. The 1st respondent informed that the\nstock would be released only if the said amount was deposited and promised that the petitioner's submissions\nwill be heard during  the assessment proceedings. Believing the same, the petitioner deposited Rs.5,15,000/-\nand got released the stock and vehicle on 14-3-2018 with a fond hope that notice would be issued calling for\nhis objections and matter would be heard. Learned counsel further argued that though one year elapsed, there\nwas no response from the authorities and in those circumstances the petitioner filed application under section\n67 dated 17-11-2019  for the refund of the amount minus tax. It was only at that juncture, the 2nd respondent\nwho is the Assistant  Commissioner , issued a notice of rejection of refund application under Form-GST -RFD-\n08 inform ing for the first time that out of the amount collected from the petitioner on 14-3-2018, Rs.\n4,82,500/- was appropriated towards the enforcement collection under section 130 of AP GST Act and hence\nthe petitioner was not entitled to claim refund, meaning thereby , the 1st respon dent invoked the confiscation\nproceedings under section 130 on 11-3-2018 and in lieu of confiscation, collected fine of Rs. 4,82,500/- and\nbalance towards tax and penalty , totalling to Rs. 5,15,000/-. Learned counsel vehemently argued that the\nreason mentioned for rejection of the refund application is unjust and illegal, inasmuch as, the authority never\ninvoked confiscation proceedings under section 130. Rather the 1st respondent invoked the procedure under\nsection 129 for the seizer of the goods and conveyance . As stated  supra , since the goods were perishable, the\npetitioner had to pay the amount dema nded by the 1st respondent under protest and it was promised that\nduring the assessment proceedings, the petitioner's objections will be conside red and order will be passed.\nHence, the question  of 1st respondent invoking confiscation proceedings unde r Section 130 does not arise.\nSince the entire proceedings were taken up without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner ,\nprinciples of natural justice were violated. He thus prayed to  set aside the \"summary order\" dated 2-12-2019.\n7. Per contra, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes argued that on 11-3-2018 the 1st respondent\nwhile intercepting the vehicle, found that the flower tamarind was being transported without relevant\ndocuments. As the driver failed to produce the documents, he initiated the confiscation proceedings under\nsection 130 of AP GST Act and issued show cause notice wherein he clearly mentioned that he was invoking\nthe confiscation proceedings under section 130 of AP GST Act. Having received the same, the petitioner filed\na confession letter dated 12-3-2018 admitting his guilt. Thereafter , 1st respondent issued proceedings dated\n14-3-2018 and collected fine of Rs. 4,15,000/- in lieu of confiscation and penalty of Rs. 32,500/- each and\nreleased the commodities. To that effect, a release order dated 14-3-2018 was also issued. Learned\nGovernment Pleade r vehemently argued that in view of aforesaid proceedings, particularly the confession\nletter admitting his guilt, the writ petition is not maintainable. He argued that the petitioner cannot now argue\nthat no show cause notice was issued and principles of natural justice were violated. He thus prayed to dismiss\nthe writ petition.\n8. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow?\n(a) We gave our anxious consideration to the above respective ar guments.\n(b) Section 68 r/w Rule 138, 138A, sections 129 & 130 of A.P. GST Act are german e at this juncture to\nknow the powers of the authorities to inspect the goods which are in movement or transit andproceedings that will follow if the good s are not covered by relevant documents. Section 68 lays\ndown that the Gove rnment may require the person in-char ge of a conveyance who is carrying on\nany consignment of goods of value exceeding Rs. 50,000/- to carry with him the relevant\ndocuments and devices to show to the proper of ficer who is authorized to inspect the vehicle.\n(c) Rule 138 of A.P Goods and Services Tax, 2017 says that every registered person who causes\nmovement of goods of consignment value exceeding Rs. 50,000/-, shall furnish the information\nrelating to the said goods electronicall y on the common portal and obtain a e-Way Bill. Such\nrequirement of furnishing information relating to goods consignment arises when the goods are (1)\nin relation to supply  or (2) or for reaso ns other than supply or (3) due to inward supply from a\nunauthorised person.\n(d) Then Section 138 (A) prescribes the documents and devices to be carried by a person in-char ge of a\nconveyance. It lays down thus:\n \"138A. (1) The person-in-char ge of a conveyance shall carry\u2014\n(a) the invoice or bill of supply or delivery challan, as the case may be; and\n(b) a copy of the e-way bill in physical form or the e-way bill number in electronic form or\nmapped to a Radio Frequency Identification Device embedded on to the conveyance in\nsuch manner as may be notified by the Commissioner:\n Provided  that nothing contained in clause (b) of this sub-rule shall apply in case of\nmovement of goods by rail or by air or vessel.\n** ** **\n(e) Rule 138B deals with verification of documents and conveyances. This provision says that the\nProper Officer who is authorized in this behalf can intercept any conveyance to verify the e-way\nbill in physical or electronic form for all interstate and intrastate movement of the goods. He can\nalso make a physical verification of the conveyance.\n(f) Then it should be noted, for contraven tion of the above provisions, the proper Officer has two\ncourses to follow under section 129 and 130 of the Act. Section 129 deals with detention, seizure\nand releas e of goods and conveyance in transit. Whereas Section 130 deals with confiscation of\ngoods or conveyance and levy of penalty .\n9. It should be noted, a question had arisen  as to whether the proceedings under section 129 and 130 of the AP\nGST Act can be initiated simultaneously . In Syner gy Fertichem Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat  [2019] 112\ntaxmann.com 370, a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dealt with the precise question as to whether\nsection 129 & 130 of CGST Act overla p or are independent to each other . On an elaborate discussion, they\ngave their final conclusions as follows:\n\"(i) Section 129 of the Act talks about detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyances in\ntransit. On the other hand, section 130 talks about confiscation of goods or conveyance and levy of\ntax, penalty and fine thereof. Although, both the sections start with a non-obstante  clause, yet, the\nharmonious reading of the two sectio ns, keeping in mind the object and purpose behind the\nenactment thereof, would indicate that they are independent of each other . Section 130 of the Act,\nwhich provides for confiscation of the goods or conveyance is not, in any manner , dependent or\nsubject to section 129 of the Act. Both the sections ar e mutually exclusive.  (emphasis supplied ).\n(ii) The phras e \"with an intent to evade the payment of tax\" in section 130 of the Act assumes\nimportance. When the law requires an intention to evade payment of tax, then it is not mere failure\nto pay tax. It must be something more. The word \"evade\" in the context means defeating the\nprovisions of law of paying tax. It is made more stringent by use of the word \"intent\". The assessee\nmust deliberately avoid the payment of tax which is payable in accor dance with law. However , the\nelement of  mens r ea cannot be r ead into section 130 of the Act.  (emphasis supplied ).\n(iii) For the purpose of issuing a notice of confiscation under section 130 of the Act at the threshold, i.e.,\nat the stage of detention and seizure of the goods and conveyance, the case has to be of such anature that on the face of the entire transaction, the authority concerned should  be convinced that\nthe contravention was with a definite  intent to evade payment of tax. The action, in such\ncircumstances, should be in good faith and not be a mere pretence. In other words, the authorities\nneed to make out a very strong case. Mere suspicion may not be sufficient to invoke section 130 of\nthe Act straightway .\n(iv) If the authorities are of the view that the case is one of the invoking section 130 of the Act at the\nevery threshold, then they need to record their reasons for such belief in writing and such reasons\nrecorded in writing should, thereafter , be looked into by the superior authority so that the superior\nauthority can take an appropriate decis ion whether the case is one of straightw ay invoking section\n130 of the Act  (emphasis supplied )\n(v) Even if the goods or the conveyance is released upon payment of the tax and penalty under section\n129 of the Act, later, if the authorities find something incriminating against the owner of the goods\nin the course of the inquiry , if any, then it would be permissible to them to initiate the confiscation\nproceedings under section 130 of the Act.\n(vi) Section 130 of the Act is no dependen t on sub-section (6) of section 129 of the Act (emphasis\nsupplied).\n(vii) Sections 129 and 130 respectively of the Act are mutually exclusive and independent of each other .\n(emphasis supplied). If the amount of tax and penalty , as determined under section 129 of the Act\nfor the purpose of release of the goods and the conveyance, is not deposited within the statutory\ntime period, then the consequence of the same would be forfeiture of the goods and the vehicle with\nthe Gover nment. This does not necessarily imply that the confiscation proceedings can be initiated\nonly in the event of the failure on the part of the owner of the goods or the conveyance in\ndepositing the amount towards the tax and liability determined under section 129 of the Act.\n(viii) For the purpose of section 129(6) of the Act, it would not be necessary for the department to\nestablish any intention to evade payment of tax. If the tax and penalty , as determined under section\n129, is not deposited within the statutory time period, then the goods and the conveyance shall be\nliable to be put to auction and the sale proceeds shall be deposited with the Government.\n(ix) to ( xvi) ** ** **\n** ** **\nThus it was held that sections 129 & 130 are mutually exclusive procedures.\n10. With the above jurisprudence, we have carefully scrutinized the facts of the case and record produced. As\ncan be seen the 1st respondent filed show cause notice in GC No. 38/2017-1 8 dated 11-3-2018 said to be\nissued by him to the petitioner informing that for the reasons stated in the said notice, he proposed to\nconfiscate the goods worth of Rs. 6,50,000/- by invoking the powers under section 68 r/w 138 of the GST Act,\n2017 and section 20 of IGST Act, 2017. He also mentioned that in lieu of confi scation, an option of payment\nof fine of Rs. 4,15,000/- was given to the petitioner . It was also mentioned that the objections if any on the\naforesaid proposal can be filed with the documentary proofs within seven days from the date of receipt of the\nnotice, failing which the orders will be passed. The case of the respondent is that after issuance of the said\nnotice, the petitioner  voluntarily confessed his guilt as he had no documents for transport of the taxable goods\nand so executed confession letter dated 12-3-2018, basing on which, the 1st respondent issued proceedings\ndated 14-3-2018 and after payment of the stipulated amount, a release order of even date was also passed.\nHowever , the petitioner emphatically denied having received show cause notice dated 11-3-2018 and\nallegation of his executing confession letter .\n11. We have carefully perused the documents which are filed along with counter as Ex.R1 to R4. The show\ncause notice contains the stamp and signature of the petitioner . So also the confession letter dated 12-3-2018\nis written in vernacu lar language i.e., Telugu and it also contains the signature of the petitioner . If issuance of\nthe show cause notice and passing of the proceedings consequent upon the admission of the guilt of the\npetitioner are true, the respondents can be said to have followed the procedure contemplated under section\n130. The question is whether the show cause notice dated 11-3-2018 was issued  to the petitioner and whether\nthe petitioner executed the confession letter dated 12-3-2018. The petitioner's explanation in his reply is that\nhe did not receive the show cause notice  and did not execute the confession letter dated 12-3-2018. His furtherRUCHIexplanation is that the respondent authorities obtained his signatures along with stamp on blank papers and\nthereafter created the show cause notice and confession letter . We are unable to countenance the above\ncontention of the petitioner . In the writ averments, the petitioner at the first instance did not take any plea that\nhis signatu res were obtained on blank papers. It is only after the respondents filed their counter and enclosed\nthe show cause notice and other docum ents, then in the reply affidavit the petitioner for the first time took\nsuch plea.  Hence, in our considered view , the contention of the petitioner does not merit consideration. So at\nthe outset the confiscation proceedings and imposition of fine in lieu of confiscation etc., undertaken by the\n1st respondent cannot be said to be in violation of law and rules.\n12. We find no merits in the writ petition. Accordingly , the writ petition is dismissed. No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any , pending for consideration shall stand closed."}

Petitioner is a private limited company , essentially engaged in providing Works Contract Service. Letters\nwere issued  by the revenue requesting the petitioner  to explain the reasons for the discrepancies noted relating\nto the payment of the GST for the period from July, 2017 to March, 2020. In response, petitioner explained\nthe detailed reasons for the mismatch. Respondent No.4 issued  a show cause notice proposing demand of tax\nto a tune of Rs. 1,33,19,137/- along with interest and penalty . Petitioner filed a detailed reply to the show\ncause notice. Consequently , respondent No. 4 passed the impugned Order .\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner suffered from acute and uncontrollable\ndiabetes and Pneum onia for the last six months, as such, he could not prefer appeal within the period of 3\nmonths or within a period of one month beyond the three months by showing the sufficient cause. After the\nstipulated period, the web portal does not allow the petitioner to prefer appeal. There is a delay of 65 days as\non the date of the filing of the present Writ Petition to prefer the appeal. They have very good case on merits.RITAAccordingly , prays to consider the case of the petitioner since huge amount of tax is involved and give an\nopportunity to the petitioner to challenge the validity and correctness of the impugned Order passed by the\nrespondent No. 4 before the Appellate Authority i.e., respondent No. 3.\n5. Learned Senior Standing Counsel for C.B.I.C while opposing the Writ Petition would submit that in case\nthe Court inclined to allow the W rit Petition, suitable terms may be imposed.\n6. We have perused the material on record and also the Order impugned.\n7. Petitioner has not challenged the correctness of the impugned Order in the present Writ Petition, but,\nseeking the indulgence of the Court to condone delay of 65 days in prefer ring the appeal since due to\nunavoidable circumstances as he suf fered from severe ill-health could not prefer appeal.\n8. Needless to emphasize that as per Section 107 of the C.G.S.T Act, 2017, the petitioner has to prefer an\nappeal against the impugned Order passed by the respondent No. 4 before the respondent No. 3 within a\nperiod of three months from the date of service of the Order . Petitioner within  a period of one month after\nexpiry of three months also can file appeal against the impugned Order by showing the sufficient cause. In the\npresent case, since it is beyond the condonable period of limitation to entertain the appeal by the respondent\nNo. 3, petitioner approached this Court under Writ jurisdiction seeking indulge nce of this Court to condone\ndelay in preferring the appeal. In that view of the matter , since petitioner suffered from several health issues ,\nwhich is supported by the medical  prescriptions filed and huge amount of tax is involved in this matter , we are\ninclined to condone delay in preferring the appeal by imposing certain terms so as to enable the petitioner to\npursue his remedies under law .\n9. In the interest of justice, we consider it apposite to allow the Writ Petition and permit the petitioner to\nprefer an appeal before the respondent No. 3 within a period of one week from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis Order subject to the petitioner depositing 20% of the disputed tax.\n10.

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner seeks writ of mandamus declaring the order in\nRef.No.ZA370122025616U, dated 20.01.2022 issued by the 4th respondent cancelling the Goods and Service\nTax registration of the petitioner firm on the ground that the petitioner firm did not submit returns for a\ncontinuous period of six (6) months but without providing an opportunity of hearing as arbitrary and illegal\nand consequently set aside the same.\n2. Petitioner's case is thus:\n(a) Vide reference order in Ref.No.ZA3701 22025616U, dated 20.01.2022 the 4th respondent cancelledJYOTIthe GST Registration of the petitioner w.e.f 20.01.2022 for the reason of failure on the part of the\npetitioner to file returns for a period of six months prior to issuance of the show -cause notice dated\n02.12.2021.\n(b) Aggrieved thereby , when the petitioner filed appeal before the 3rd respondent vide order in appeal\nNo.ZD370822009762B, dated 27.08.2022, the same was dismissed on the sole ground that the\nappeal was filed with a further delay of 35 days and as per Section 107 of the GST Act, the delay\ncould be condoned for a period of one month and since the appeal was exceeding the limitation, the\nappellate authority is not vested with the powers to condone the said delay beyond 30 days.\nAccordingly , the appeal was rejected for admission.\nHence, the present writ petition.\n3. Learned counsel for petitioner , Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri, would mainly urge that the petitioner has good\nground to seek for restoration of his registration and in fact, he has mentioned the reasons for non-filing of the\nreturns and on a technical ground that appeal was filed beyond the condonable period, the appeal was rejected\nand since the GST Tribunal has not been  constituted under Section 109 of the CGST Act, the petitioner has no\nother go except invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Learned\ncounsel further submit that he submitted returns for July, 2021 to December , 2021 and paid tax. For the\nsubsequent period from July, 2022 till date, he could not submit the returns since the web portal of the\nrespondent did not permit him as his registration was cancelled. He would submit that if his returns for the\nrelevant period are accepted and registration is revived, he is ready to submit the returns for the subsequent\nperiod till date and also pay the tax due. He would thus pray to allow the writ petition and remit the matter\nback to the primary authority to consider the petitioner's case and pass appropriate orders. He would rely upon\nthe order of the Division Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangan a in W.P.No.27071 of 2022,\nChenna Krishnama Charyulu Karamp udi v. Additional Commiss ioner Appeals [2022] 142 taxmann.com\n70/94 GST 376 where under in similar circumstances, the writ petition was allowed and the matter was\nremitted to the primary authority for reconsideration of petitioner's case.\n4. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes \u2013II opposed the writ petition stating that the petitioner\nhas not filed the appeal within the time and instead filed the appeal beyond the condonable period and\ntherefore, the 3rd respondent has rightly rejected the appeal. Therefore, order of the appellate authority suffer\nno legal flaw and the writ petition is not maintainable.\n5. We perused the record and also the decision in W.P. No.27071/2022. In similar circumstances, learned\nDivision Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana having considered the fact that GST Tribunal has\nnot been constituted  under Section 109 of the CGST Act and thereby the petiti oner could not be left without\nany remed y, held that it would be just and proper if the entire matter was remitted back to the 2nd respondent\ntherein to reconsider the case of the petitioner and pass appropriate order in accordance with law .\n6. Needles to emphas ize that the above said decision applies with all its fours to the case on hand. The\npetitioner preferred appeal but it was rejected for the reasons discussed supra. In that view of the matter and as\nthe GST Tribunal has not been constituted as per the provisions of the Act so as to enable the petitioner to\npursue his further legal remedy , this writ petition is allowed and the matter is remitted back to the preliminary\nauthority i.e., the 4th respondent to consider the case of the petitioner and after verifying the returns submitted\nby the petitioner and after affording an opportunity of personal hearing pass an appropriate order in\naccordance with governing law and rules expeditiously but not later than two weeks from the date of receipt\nof a copy of this order. It is needless to emphasize that depending upon the revival of the cancellation of his\nregistration, the writ petitioner shall be liable to file his returns for the subsequent period till date and pay due\ntax.

By means of this writ petition under Article 226 of Constitution of India, the petitioner is challenging the\nproceedings for the assessment of tax for the tax period 2017-18 initiated vide show-cause notice dated 21-9-\n2023.

The challenge is on the ground that the notice has been issued under section 74 of the Central Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017 (for short 'CGST Act'), though the ingredients for initiation of the proceedings i.e.\n'suppression ' is not made out. The notice does not contain the reasons and particulars of any suppression . He\nplaces reliance in the case of Uniworth Textiles Ltd. v.

We have considered the submissions advanced and perused the material on record.\n7. The submission is that the show-cause notice does not mention any ' suppression '.\n8. Section 74(1) of the CGST Act reads as under:\n\"74. Deter mination of tax not paid or short paid or erroneously refunded or input tax credit wrongly\navailed or utilised by reason of fraud  or any wilful misstatement or suppression  of facts\n(1) Where it appears to the proper officer that any tax has not been paid or short paid or erroneously\nrefunded or where input tax credit has been wrongly availed or utilised by reason of fraud , or any wilful-\nmisstatement or suppression  of facts  to evade  tax, he shall serve notic e on the person chargeable with tax\nwhich has not been so paid or which has been so short paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been\nmade, or who has wrongly availed or utilised input tax credit, requiring him to show cause as to why he\nshould not pay the amount specified in the notice along with interest payable thereon under section 50\nand a penalty equivalent to the tax specified in the notice.\"\n9. Learned senior counsel placed much reliance on Explanation 2  of Section 74 of CGST Act which reads as\nunder:-\n\"Explanation 2 : For the purposes of this Act, the expression \"suppression \" shall mean non-declaration of\nfacts  or information which a taxable person is required to declare in the return, statement, report or any\nother document furnished under this Act or the rules made thereunder , or failure to furnish any\ninformation on being asked for , in writing, by the proper of ficer.\"\n10. We have perused the show cause notice (Ex.P1). It contains the grounds for its issuance, such as in Paras\n5, 7, 8 & 9, which reads as under:-\n\"5. From the statutory provisions mentioned above, it appears that the taxpayer is not eligible to transition\nthe credit of duty paid on inputs lying in stock as on 30-6-2017,  vide  Table-7a of the TRA N-1 filed by thetaxpayer (RUD-3), for the following reasons:\n(i) In the earlier Service Tax regime, the taxpayer is registered with Service Tax Registration\nCertificate No. AACCR9682AST001 To be eligible to transition the credit, the taxpayer\nwas not liable for registration under the existing law [Service Tax Law].\n(ii) The taxpa yer was providing works contract service and it appears that they were not\navailing of the benefit of notification No. 26/2012- Service Tax, dated the 20th June, 2012,\nwhich is a conditional exemption notification.\n(iii) The taxpayer was availing the benefit of exemption in terms of Sl.No.12A (a), 13( a) & 14\nof Notification No. 25/2012-ST dated 20-6-2012 and abatement  vide Sl.No.1 of\nNotification No. 24/2012-ST dated 6-6-2012, as reflected in the ST-3s filed for the Half-\nYear Endi ng 30-9-2016, 31-3-2017 & 30-6-2017, in respect of Works Contract Service,\nwhich appears to be outside the scope of the provisions of Section 140(3) of the CGST\nAct, 2017\n7. CONTRA VENTIONS:\n7.1 Section 59 of the CGST Act pr ovides:\nEvery registered person shall self-assess the taxes  paya ble under this Act and furnish a return for each tax\nperiod as specified under section 39.\nSection 59 - Self-assessment\nIn the age of liberalisation, huge amount of trust and faith have been posed on the taxpayers. Revenue\ndepartment allows the tax payer to determine his tax liability by himself.  Since tax liability is determin ed\nby the tax paye r himself, therefore, the term is labelled as self-assessment. Section 59 of CGST Act\ncovers self-assessme nt under GST regim e. In the course of day to day business, a tax payer will do self-\nassessment and determine tax liability according to each and every sale invoice. The self-assessment is to\nbe completed, except in the case of \"provisional assessment\", with regard to value and rate of tax etc., at\nthe time and place of supply so that correct tax liability is ascertain ed and dischar ged. The other aspect of\nself-assessment is that at the end of tax period, the assessee is required to furnish a return electronically\nspecified under section 39 also certifying correctness of the data furnished and tax paid for each tax\nperiod to the taxati on department so that departmental officials are able to scrutinise correctness of\npayment of taxes . Self-assessment is applicable to all the taxable persons under GST .\nIt appears that the taxpayer contravened the provisions of Section 59 of the CGST Act, 2017 and\nrendered themselves liable to penalty under section 125 of the CGST Act, 2017. Section 125 reads:\nSection 125: General penalty  (Relevant Rule 142)\nAny person, who contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or any rules made thereunder for which no\npenalty is separately  provided for in this Act, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to twenty five\nthousand rupees.\n8. It appears that since the taxpayer is registered under the Service Tax Law, they are not eligible to\ntransit the cenvat credit pertaining to the existing law, under the provisions of Section 140(3) of\nCGST/APGST Act, 2017. However , they have carried forward the credit to GST as a dealer . Further , the\ncarrying forward of credit under section  140(3) is a conditional one, viz., the taxpa yer shall be availing\nNotification No. 26/2012-ST which the taxpayer has not fulfilled. The acts of the taxpayer attract the\nprovisions of Explanation  (ii) to Section 74 of the CGST Act, 2017,  viz., (i) non- declaration of facts  and\n(i) non-declaration of information, with an intention to avail transition credit fraudulently unless noticed\nby the audit. Theref ore, it appears that the irregularly availed transitional input tax credit is recoverable\nby invoking extended period of limitation and penalty can be imposed under the provisions of Section 74\n(1) of the CGST Act. 2017.\n9. In terms of the above statutory and recovery provisions, it appears that the taxpayer wrongly carried\nforward the transitio n credit of Rs. 1,75,30,798/-  vide  Table 7a of the Transitional Credit/Stoc k Statement\nfiled by the taxpayer and the said amount is recoverable along with interest and penalty .\"11. In view of the above, we are not convinced with the submission that the show cause notice does not\ncontain the reasons for its issuance.\n12. As per the Explanation 2 , suppression  shall mean non-dec laration of facts  or inform ation, which a taxable\nperson is required to declare in the return, statement, report or any other docum ent furnished under the Act or\nthe rules made thereunder , or failure to furnish any information on being asked  for, in writing, by the proper\nofficer. The question  if there is suppression  or not can be determined by the authority , considering the reply , if\nso filed. 'Suppression ' is a question of fact. In view of the explanation, whether the facts  upon which show\ncause notice has been issued, constitute suppression  or not cannot be determined at this stage in the exercise\nof writ jurisdiction. Use of word 'suppression ' is not conclusive. Similarly , if this expression is not used in the\nshow cause notice it cannot be said conclusively that there is no suppression . The petitioner by filing reply to\nthe show-cause notice can demonstra te before the authority that there was no suppression . Besides,\n'suppression ' alone is not the ground under section 74(1) of CGST Act. Fraud  or/and willful misstatement are\nalso the grounds for issuance of show cause notice in evading  tax etc.\n13. The impu gned show  cause notice was issued on 21-9-2023. In the prayer clause, as reproduced above, the\nimpugned notice was said to be barred by limitation. However , the learned senior counsel during arguments,\non the same being pointed out by learned standing counsel that the notice is not barred by limitation, also\nsubmitted that the notice was within the period of limitation of three years for the notice even under section\n73.\n14. So, the impugned show cause notice issued mentioning under section 74 but on the grounds it has been\nissued, even if not mentioning ' suppression ', would be within the period of limitatio n under section 73 as well,\nas it is submitted by the learned counsels for the parties that the limitation was upto 30-9-2019 under section\n73.\n15. So, even  if the submission of learned counsel for the petitioners be acceptable, though we are not\nexpressing any view on that aspect, no fault can be found in the notice and it cannot be said to be without\njurisdiction or barred by limitation, under section 73 and therefore having been issued under section 74 to\novercome the bar of limitation.\n16. In Uniworth Textiles Ltd. (supra ), the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the show cause notice must fulfill the\nrequirement of the proviso to Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 (as was in that case) which finds\napplication only when specific and explicit averments challenging the fides of the conduct of the assessee are\nmade in the show-cause notice, which requirement in that the show-cause notice in that case failed to meet.\n17. In Uniworth Textiles Ltd. (supra ), there was challenge to the order . From the evidence adduced by the\nappellant therein, it was observed that one will draw an inference of bonafide  conduct in fact of the appellant\ntherein. In the said case, it was held that the burden of proving  malafide  conduct under the proviso to Section\n28 of Customs Act lies with the Revenue, that in furtherance of the same,  no specific averments were\nmentioned in the show cause notice which was the mandatory requirement for commencement of action under\nthe proviso to Section 28. There was also nothing on record to display a willful default on the part of the\nappellant therein. Consequently , it was held that the extended period of limitation under proviso of Section 28\ncould not be invoked against the appellant.\n18. In the present case, in view of the submissions advanced as also the admitted position that the limitation\nperiod for notice under section 73 did not expire on the date the impugned notice was issued, the question of\nextended period of limitation for issua nce of notice under section 74 is not involved. Had it been, the\ncontention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the period of limitation for issuance of notice under\nsection 73 had expired but any such notice was not issued and consequently to overcome the bar of limitation,\nthe notice was issued under section 74 even without satisfying the requirements of Section 74 the\nconsideration might have been dif ferent.\n19. In Vijaya Venkata Durga Oil Traders  (supra ), the Division Bench of High Court  of Judicature at\nHyderabad considered the judgment in Uniworth T extiles Ltd.  (supra ). It was held that if the allegations in the\nshow cause notice accepted as true show  that the dealer had committed willful evasion of tax and the finding\nrecorded in the assessment order establish that the assessee had willfully evaded  tax, it would suffice to\nextended period of limitation in terms of Section 21(5) of APVAT Act, 2005 notwithstanding that the show-\ncause notice did not refer to Section 21(5) and did not specifically use the words  'wilful evasion of tax'. It was\nfurther held that it was, therefore, necessary to refer to the contents of show cause notice.20. The aforesaid judgment cited by learned counsel for the petitioner , does not support his contentions. On\nthe contrary from the said judgment, the relevant part being reproduced shortly , what follows is that the\ncontents of the show  cause notice determine the true nature of the notice as to under which provision it has\nbeen issued, notwithstanding that it does not refer a particular provision or it does not specifically use the\nwords as mentioned in the Section.\n\"\u2026\u2026If the allegations in the show-cause notice, accepted as true, show that the dealer had committed\nwillful evasion of tax, and the finding recorded in the assess ment order establish that the assessee had\nwillfully evaded  tax, it would suffice to extend the period of limitation in terms of Section 21(5) of the\nAct notwithstanding the show-cause notice does not refer to Section 21(5) and does not specifically use\nthe words wilful evasion of tax. It is, therefore, necessary for us to refer to the contents of show cause\nnotice.\"\n21. In the present case we find that the show cause notice mentioned the grounds for its issuance. Even if it be\ntaken that the ' suppression ' is not mentioned, to meet the requirement of Section 74 to issue the notice. It is not\nthe submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that it does not meet the requirements of Section 73.\nFurther the submissi on is that the notice should be under section 73 but it mentions under section 74. We are\nof the view that mere mention of a provision would not be determinative of the notice under that section. It\ndependents upon the contents.\n22. In W.P.No.28743 of 2023 decided on 9-11-2023, the Coordinate Bench of this Court held in paras 26 to 30\nas follows; on the point of entertainability of the writ petition against the show cause notice.\n\"26. In Special Dir ector  v. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse  (2004) 3 SCC 440 the Hon'ble Apex Court deprecated\nthe practice of High Courts entertainin g writ petitions questioning the legalit y of show cause notices\nstalling enquiries as proposed and retarding investigative process. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that\nunless the High Court is satisfied that the show cause notice was totally  non est in the eye of the law for\nabsolute want of jurisdiction of the authority to even investigate into facts , the writ petitions should not\nbe entertained for the mere asking and as a matter of routine, and the writ petitioner should invariably be\ndirected to respond to the show cause notice and take all stands highlighted in the writ petition.\n27. It is apt to refer paragraph-5 of Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse  (supra ) as under:\n\"5. This Court in a large number of cases has deprecated the practice of the High  Courts entertaining writ\npetitions questioning legality of the show-cause notices stalling enquiries as proposed and retarding\ninvestigative process to find actual facts  with the participation and in the presen ce of the parties. Unless\nthe High Court is satisfied that the show-cause notice was totally  non est in the eye of the law for\nabsolute want of jurisdiction of the authority to even investigate into facts , writ petitions shou ld not be\nentertained for the mere asking and as a matter of routine, and the writ petitio ner should invariably be\ndirected to respond to the show-cause notice and take all stands highlighted in the writ petition. Whether\nthe show-cause notice was founded on any legal premises, is a jurisdictional issue which can even be\nurged by the recipie nt of the notice and such issues also can be adjudicated by the authority issuing the\nvery notice initially , before the aggriev ed could approach the court. Further , when the court passes an\ninterim order it should be careful to see that the statutory functionaries specially and specifically\nconstituted for the purpose are not denuded of powers and authority to initially decide the matter and\nensure that ultimate relief which may or may not be finally granted in the writ petition is not accorded to\nthe writ petitioner even at the threshold by the interim protection granted.\"\n28. In CCE  v. Krishna Wax (P) Ltd. (2020) 12 SCC 572 the Hon'ble Apex Court reiterated that it is well\nsettled that writ petition should normally not be entertained against mere issuan ce of show cause notice.\nThe said matter pertained to the Centra l Excise Act. It was held that excise law is a complete code in\nitself and it would normally not be appro priate to writ court to entertain writ petition under Article 226 of\nthe Constitution of India and that the person concerned must first raise all the objections before the\nauthority who had issued the show cause notice and the redressal in terms of the existing provisions of\nthe law could be taken resort to if an adverse order is passed against such person.\n29. It is apt to refer paragraphs-14 and 15 of Krishna W ax (P) Ltd.  (supra ) as under:\n\"14. It has been laid down by this Court that the excise law is a complete code in itself and it would\nnormally not be appropriate for a writ court to entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution\nand that the person concerned must first raise all the objections before the authority who had issued aRITAshow-cause notice and the redressal in terms of the existing provisions of the law could be taken resort to\nif an adve rse order was passed against such person. For example in Union of India  v. Guwahati Carbon\nLtd. [Union of India  v. Guwahati Carbon Ltd., (2012) 11 SCC 651] , it was concluded; \"The Excise Law\nis a comp lete code in order to seek redress in excise matters and hence may not be appropriate for the\nwrit court to entert ain a petition unde r Article 226 of the Constitution\", while in Malladi Drugs &\nPharma Ltd.  v. Union of India [Malladi Drugs & Pharma Ltd. v. Union of India , (2020) 12 SCC 808] , it\nwas observed:\n\"\u2026 The High Cour t, has, by the impugned judgment held that the appellant should first raise all the\nobjections before the Authority who have issued the show-cause notice and in case any adverse order is\npassed against the appellant, then liberty has been granted to approach the High Court \u2026\n\u2026 in our view , the High Court was absolutely right in dismissing the writ petition against a mere show-\ncause notice.\"\n15. It is thus well settled that writ petition should normally not be entertained against mere issuance of\nshow-cause notice. In the present case no show-cause notice was even issued when the High Court had\ninitially entertained the petition and directed the Department to prima facie  consider whether there was\nmaterial to proceed with the matter .\"\n30. In the present case, APGST Act is also a complete code and consequently , we are of the considered\nview that the petitio ner should respond to the show cause notice raising all such objections, as may be\nraised before the authority issuing the show cause notice and in case any advers e order is passed and the\npetitioner feels aggrieved, the petitioner may then have recourse to the appropriate proceedings.\"\n23. For all the aforesaid reasons we are of the considered view that the presen t writ petition against the\nimpugned show cause notice is not liable to be entertained.\n24. The Writ Petition is dismissed, however , leaving it open to the petitioner to approach the competent\nauthority by filing reply and raising such objections as may be open under law and as may be advised.\n25. No order as to costs.\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand dismissed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

In such circumstances, both these Writ Petitions are disposed of by way of\nthis Common Order .\n2. Heard Sri V. Bhaskar Reddy , learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Sri V. Siddharth Reddy ,\nlearned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax.\n3. The petitioners herein are dealers of scrap iron and were transporting scrap iron for sale to a dealer in\nTelangana State. The vehicles in which this scrap iron was being transported was stopped for verification and\ninspection on 27.04.2024 by the Deputy  Assistant Commissioner (ST)-2, Office of the Regional Vigilance &\nEnforcement Department, Kadapa. He is arrayed as the 1st respondent in both the W rit Petitions.\n4. After verifying the documents available with the driver of the conveyance, the 1st responde nt issued a\nnotice in Form GST MOV -10, under Section 130 of the Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 [for the\nshort \"the CGST , Act\"], on 01.05.2024 calling upon the petitioners to showcause why the goods under\ntransport and as well as the vehicle in which the goods have been transported should not be confiscated. These\nnotices were served on the driver of the vehicle.\n5. Ther eafter , the petitioners have filed their objections dated 08.05.2024, setting out the grounds why the\nproposed action should be dropped. After receipt of these objections, the 1st responden t passed orders, in both\ncases, dated 25.05.2 024, confiscating the goods as well as the vehicle under Section 130 of the CGST , Act,\nSection 130 of the State Goods and Services Act /Section 21 of the Union Territory Goods and Service Tax,\nAct and under Section 20 of the Integrated Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017. The petitioners were also\ninformed that the above said goods and conveyance could be released on paym ent of the penalty and fine set\nout in the said orders.\n6. Aggrieved by these two orders, the petitioners have approached this Court by way of the present Writ\nPetitions.\n7. Sri V. Bhaskar Reddy , learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Sri V. Siddharth Reddy , learned\ncounsel for the petitioner in the matter , would submit that the proceedings, including the orders of\nconfiscation dated 25.05.2024, are invalid and without jurisdiction. He would submit that in the event of any\ngoods being transported in contravention of the provisions of the CGST Act, the authorities can at best initiate\naction, for detention and seizure, under Section 129 of the CGST , Act and only in the event of such action\nculminating in an order of seizure and detention and subsequent failure of the dealer to pay the amounts\ndemanded under the said order of deten tion can the authorities initiate action under Section 130 of the CGST\nAct. He would submit that in the present case the 1st respondent, without invoking the provisions of Section\n129 of the CGST Act had straight away issued notices under Section 130 of the CGST Act, which is\nimpermissible and is not in accordance with the scheme of the Act. He relies upon Circular No. 41/15/2018-\nGST, dated 13.04.2018 issued by Central Board of Indirect T axes and Customs.\n8. He would contend that even assuming that there is a possibility of invoking Section 130 of the CGST Act\ndirectly , such invocation would require formation of a Prima face satisfaction that there has been transport of\ngoods with an intention to evade tax. A perusal of the show-cause notice does not reveal any such formation\nof satisfaction and consequently , notices under Section 130 of the CGST , Act could not have been issued\ndirectly . He would submit that the order of confiscation, dated 25.05.2024, in both the cases, contain reasons\nwhich were not available in the show-cause notices and the petitioners were not given an opportunity to\nanswer such findings in as much as they were never put to the petitioners.\n9. The Notices were only served on the driver of conveyance and statements were taken from the driver\nwithout any opportunity being given to the petitioners to show that the said statements may not be correct. He\nwould also contend that the show-cause  notices as well as the orders of detention show that the some kind ofan inquiry was cond ucted by the authorities and the report of such inquiry was not furnished to the petitioners\neven after a specific request was made in the reply to the show-cause notices.\n10. He would  contend that any detention of goods or conveyance can only be done on issuance of Form\nMOV -6 under Section 129 of the CGST  Act and there is no provision under Section 130 of the CGST Act for\ndetention of the goods. He would submit that detention of the goods without issuance of such Form MOV -6 is\nclearly impermissible and beyond of the jurisdiction and authority of the 1st respondent.\n11. He would also contend that Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs had issued a circular bearing\nNo.128/47/2019-GST , dated 23.12.2019 instructing all officials of the respective GST Departments that all\ncommunications/orders should contain Document Identification Numbers so as to authenticate the issuance of\nsuch comm unications/orders. He would further submit that in the present case no such DIN is available on the\norder of confiscation dated 25.05.2024 and consequently , the said orders would have to be set aside.\n12. The learned senior counsel, in summation of the above contentions would submit that orders of\nconfiscation suf fer from lack of jurisdiction apart from a clear violation of the principles of natural justice.\n13. The learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax, in reply , would submit that the provisions of\nSections 129 & 130 of the CGST Act deal with different situations. He would submit that Section 129 of the\nCGST Act would be applicable where there is transport of goods in contravention of the provisions of the\nCGST Act. This contravention could be on account of negligence or any other reason without intent to evade\npayment of taxes. However , Section 130 of the CGST has a larger ambit. Whil e Section 129 of the CGST is\napplicable only when the goods are being transported, the provisions of Section 130 would apply across all\nfact situations, including during transpo rt of goods, wherever there is an intent to evade tax. He would submit\nthat the distinction between these two provisions is whether any action has been taken by a dealer with an\nintent to evade tax or not.\n14. The learn ed Gover nment Pleader for Commercial Tax would submit that wherever the authorities, on a\nprima facie  view, are of the opinion that there is a clear intention to evade payment of tax, it would be open to\nthe authorities to initiate action under Section 130 of CGST directly and without having to involve Section\n129 of CGST , Act.\n15. The learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax on the question of the principles of natural justice\nand the manner in which the show-cause notices have been issued prior to the passing of the order , would\nsubmit that the show -cause notices have clearly made out a case for invocation  of Section 130 of CGST , Act\nand that the show-cause notices have set out the grounds on which the provision s of Section 130 of CGST Act\nare being invoked. He would further submit that the impugned orders dated 25.05.2024, passed by the 1st\nrespondent would also cover all the issues which had been recorded in the order of confiscation.\n16. The learn ed Gover nment Pleader for Commercial Tax further would submit  that DIN number is only\nnecessary where the orders are being served on the dealers even before they are uploaded on the portal. He\nwould submit that wherever the orders are uploaded on the portal of the department, it is not necessary to af fix\nany DIN number on such orders.\n17. V. Bhaskar Reddy , learned Senior Counsel, in reply , would submit that there is no distinction between\norders uploaded on the portal of the department and the orders which are served directly on the dealers. He\nwould submit that the circular clearly covers both kinds of orders and there can no order without a DIN\nnumber .\n18. Both sides have relied upon the Judgm ent of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad, in the case of\nSiddhbali Stone Gallery  v. State of Gujarat [2020] 115 taxmann.com 313/80 GST 206 which had followed its\nown Judg ment in the Case of Syner gy Fertichem (P.) Ltd. v. State of Gujarat [2019] 112 taxmann.com\n370/[2020] 33 G.S.T .L. 513 /[Special Civil Application No. 4730 of 2019, dated 23-12-2019].\nConsideration of the Court :\n19. The contentions raised on both sides gives rise to the following issues.\n(1) Whether action can be taken under Section 30 of the CGST Act only after action had been initiated\nunder Section 129 of the CGST Act?\n(2) Whether action taken under Section 130 of the CGST Act, without a prior invocation of Section129 of the Act would render the proceedings under Section 130 of the CGST Act invalid?\n(3) Whether non affixture of DIN Number on the order of confiscation would render the said order\ninvalid?\n20. At the outset, it is clarified that this Court is not going into the merits of the case in as much as the said\nmerits of the case require a determination of facts and this Court declines to go into these facts.\n21. Section 129 and 130 of the Act reads as follows:\n129.  Detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyances in transit.\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, where any person transports any goods or stores\nany goods while they are in transit in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules made\nthereunder , all such goods and conveyance used as a means of transport for carrying the said goods\nand docum ents relating to such goods and conveyance shall be liable to detention or seizure and\nafter detention or seizure, shall be released, -\n(a) on paymen t of penalty equal to two hund red per cent of the tax payable on such goods and,\nin case of exempted goods, on payment of an amount equal to two per cent of the value of\ngoods or twenty-five thousand rupees, whichever is less, where the owner of the goods\ncomes forward for payment of such penalty;\n(b) on paymen t of penalty equal to fifty per cent of the value of the goods or two hundred per\ncent of the tax payable on such goods, whichever is higher , and in case of exempted goods,\non payment of an amount equal to five per cent of the value of goods or twenty-five\nthousand rupees, whichever is less, where the owner of the goods does not come forward\nfor payment of such penalty;\n(c) upon furnishing a security equivalent to the amount payable under clause (a) or clause (b)\nin such form and manner as may be prescribed:\nProvided that no such goods or conveyance shall be detained or seized without serving an order of\ndetention or seizure on the person transporting the goods.\n(2) Omitted vide the Finance Act, 2021, ef fective from 01.01.2022 by Central Government.\n(3) The prope r officer detaining or seizing goods or conveyance shall issue a notice within seven days\nof such detention or seizure, specifying  the penalty payable, and thereafter , pass an order within a\nperiod of seven days from the date of service of such notice, for payment of penalty under clause\n(a) or clause ( b) of sub-section (1).\n(4) No penalty shall be determined under sub-section (3) without giving the person concerned an\nopportunity of being heard.\n(5) On payment of amount referred in sub-s ection (1), all proceedings in respect of the notice specified\nin sub-section (3) shall be deemed to be concluded.\n(6) Where the person transporting any goods or the owner of such goods fails to pay the amount of\npenalty under subsection (1) within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the copy of the order\npassed under sub-section (3), the goods or conveyance so detained or seized shall be liable to be\nsold or disposed of otherwise, in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed, to\nrecover the penalty payable under sub-section (3):\nProvided that the conveyance shall be released on payment by the transporter of penalty under sub-\nsection (3) or one lakh rupees, whichever is less;\nProvided further  that where the detained or seized good s are perishable or hazardous in nature or are\nlikely to depreciate in value with passag e of time, the said period of fifteen days may be reduced by the\nproper of ficer.\n130.  Confiscation of goods or conveyances and levy of penalty:(1) Where any person -\n(i) supplies or receives any goods in contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or the\nrules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of tax; or\n(ii) does not account for any goods on which he is liable to pay tax under this Act; or\n(iii) supplies any goods liable to tax under this Act without having applied for registration; or\n(iv) contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder with intent to\nevade payment of tax; or\n(v) uses any conveyance as a means of transport for carriage of goods in contraven tion of the\nprovisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder unless the owner of the conveyance\nproves that it was so used without the knowledge or connivance of the owner himself, his\nagent, if any, and the person in charge of the conveyance, then, all such goods or\nconveyances shall be liable to confiscation and the person shall be liable to penalty under\nsection 122.\n(2) Whenever confiscation of any goods or conveyance is authorised by this Act, the officer adjudging\nit shall give to the owner of the goods an option to pay in lieu of confiscation, such fine as the said\nofficer thinks fit:\nProvided that  such fine leviable shall not exceed the market value of the goods confiscated, less the tax\nchargeable thereon:\nProvided further  that the aggregate of such fine and penalty leviable shall not be less than the penalty\nequal to hundred per cent of the tax payable on such goods;\nProvided also that where any such conveyance is used for the carriage of the goods or passengers for\nhire, the owner of the conveyance shall be given an option to pay in lieu of the confiscation of the\nconveyance a fine equal to the tax payable on the goods being transported thereon.\n(3) Omitted vide the Finance Act, 2021, ef fective from 1-1-2022.\n(4) No order for confiscation of goods or conveyance or for imposition of pena lty shall be issued\nwithout giving the person an opportunity of being heard.\n(5) Where any goods or conveyance are confiscated under this Act, the title of such goods or\nconveyance shall thereupon vest in the Government.\n(6) The prope r officer adjudging confiscati on shall take and hold possession of the things confiscated\nand every officer of Police, on the requisition of such proper officer, shall assis t him in taking and\nholding such possession.\n(7) The proper officer may, after satisfying  himself that the confiscated goods or conveyance are not\nrequired in any other proceedings unde r this Act and after giving reasonable time not exceeding\nthree months to pay fine in lieu of confiscation, dispose of such goods or conveyance and deposit\nthe sale proceeds thereof with the Government.\n22. Sri V. Bhaskar Reddy , the learned Senior Counsel contends that authorities would have to first initiate\naction under Section  129 of the Act in the event of any prima facie  contraven tion of the provisions of Act or\nRules in transporting goods. Thereafter , opportunity is to be given to the dealer or the person in-char ge of the\nconveyance to show that there has been no contravention of the Act or Rules. The provisions of Section 130\nwould also be invok ed, in the event of the detaining authority , coming to a further conclusion that there has\nbeen a contravention  of the Act and Rule s in the transport of the concerned goods on account of the attempt of\nthe dealer to evade tax. The learned Senior Counsel would show that any other interpretation would not be in\naccordance with the scheme of Section  129 and 130 of the Act. He would submit that the conditions for\ninvocation of Section 129 and 130 are essentially the requirement that there has been a contravention of the\nprovisions of the Act or the Rules. It is only after such a finding is given and a further question of whether the\ntransport of goods was done in contravention of the Act and Rules for the purposes of evading tax arises thatthe provisions of Section 130 of the CGST Act can be applied. The learned Senior Counsel would further\nsubmit that, leaving it open to the autho rity on the spot, to decide whether he will proceed under Section 129\nor section 130 of the CGST Act, would give uncanalised and_arbitrary power to the authority to initiate, either\nthe provisions of Section 129 for detaining and seizing the goods or the provisions of Section 130 for\nconfiscating the goods and levying penalty . Such uncanalised power would be against the principles of\nequality and reasonableness and would  amount to delegation of power without any regulation. The learned\nsenior counsel would submit that such an interpretation can be avoided if any action in relation to any\ncontravention of the Act or Rules, in the transport of goods, commences only by way of proceedings under\nSection 129 and subsequently under Section 130 if there is prima facie  case of an attempt to evade tax.\n23. The learned senior counsel also relied on the circular dated 13.04.2018 mentioned above. This circular set\nout the procedure for interception of conveyances for inspection of goods in movement and detention, release\nand confiscation of such goods and conveyance. Clause-II (a) to (j) set out the proced ure for exercising the\npower under Section 129 of the CGST Act for seizure or detention of goods and conveyances. Clause-II (k)\nreads as follows:\n\"In case the propose d tax and penalty are not paid within seven days from the date of the issue of the\norder of detention in Form GST MOV -06, action under section 130 of the CGST  Act shall be initiated by\nserving an notice in FORM GDT MOV -10, proposing confiscation of the goods and conveyance and\nimposition of penalty .\"\n24. While this ar gument looks attractive at first blush, clause-II ( l) reads as follows:\n\"Where the proper officer is of the opinion that such movement of goods is being effected to evade\npayment of tax, he may directly invoke section 130 of the CGST Act by issuing a notice proposing to\nconfiscate the goods and conveyance in FORM GST MOV -10.\"\nA reading of clause-II (l) shows that the CBIC had also understood the scheme of Section 129 and 130 of the\nCGST Act to be two provisions that operate in two separate fields and that provisions of Section 130 can\nalways be invoked directly without a prior invocation of Section 129 of the CGST Act.\n25. The question of the interplay between Section 129 and 130 of the CGST Act was considered, by a\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Gujarat and Ahmadabad, in a case of Syner gy Fertichem (P.) Ltd.\n(supra ). This judgment was followed by the High Court of Gujarat in the case of Siddhbali Stone Gallery\n(supra ). In Syner gy Fertichem (P.) Ltd. (supra ), the Division Bench of the Hon'ble High  Court of Gujarat was\nconsidering a similar question of whether proceedings under Section 130 of the CGST Act can be initiated\nwithout any prior proceedings under Section 129 of the CGST Act. The view taken by the Hon'ble High Court\nof Gujarat has been summarised in paragraphs 101 and 102 of the said Judgment which are extracted.\n101.  We are of the view that at the time of detention and seizure of goods or convey ance, the first thing\nthe author ities need to look into closely is the nature of the contravention of the provisions of the\nAct or the Rules. The second step in the process for the authorities to examine closely is whether\nsuch contravention of the provisions of the Act or the Rules was with an intent to evade the\npayment of tax. Section 135 of the Act provides for presumption of culpable mental state but such\npresumption is available to the Department only in the cases of prosecution and not for the purpose\nof section 130 of the Act. What we are trying to convey is that in a given case, the contravention\nmay be quite trivial or may not be of such a magnitude which by itself would be sufficient to take\nthe view that the contravention was with the necessary intent to evade payment of tax.\n102.  In such circumstances, referred to above , we propose to take the view that in all cases, without any\napplication of mind and without any justifiable grounds or reasons to believe, the authorities may\nnot be justified to straightway issue a notice of confiscation under section 130 of the Act. For the\npurpose of issuing a notice of confiscation under section 130 of the Act at the threshold, i. e., at the\nstage of section 129 of the Act itself, the case has to be of such a nature that on the face of the entire\ntransaction, the authority concerned is convinced that the contravention was with a definite intent to\nevade payment of tax. We may give one simple example. The driver of the vehicle is in a position\nto produce all the relevant documents to the satisfaction of the authority concerned as regards\npayment of tax, etc., but unfortunately , he is not able to produce the e-way bill, which is also one of\nthe important documents so far as the Act, 2017 is concerned. The authentic ity of the delivery\nchallan is also not doubted. In such a situation, it would be too much for the authorities tostraightway jump to the conclusion that the case is one of confiscation, i.e, the case is of intent to\nevade payment of tax.\n26. While respectfully agreeing with the said analysis of the inter play between sections 129 and 130 of the\nCGST Act, one further aspect needs to be noticed by this Court. Section 129 applies only when goods are\nbeing transported. The provisions of Section 129 would not apply in relation to a situation where the goods\nare not in transit. The language of Secti on 129(1) specifically states that detenti on or seizure of goods can be\ncarried out while the goods are in transit , in contravention of the Provisions of the Act or the Rules made there\nunder . In the case of Section 130 confiscation of goods or conveyances and levy of penalty can be done\nsubject to any of the five conditions enumerated in Section 130 (1) being avail able. Section 131(v) provides\nfor confiscation of a conveyance where goods are being transported in such conveyance, in contravention of\nthe Act or the rules. This would mean that invocation of Section 129 will not precede all cases where Section\n130 is invoked.\n27. The Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat, after observing, as extracted above, had\ncautioned that a simple statement that the goods were being transported with an intention to evade tax, in\nnotices of confiscation would not be sufficient and there would have to be specific reasons, recorded in\nwriting as to why Section 130 of the Act is being invoked at the very threshold and that there must be material\nbased on which alone the authority could have formed such an opinion and invocation of Section 130\nbecomes necessary .\n28. In the present case, the conveyances and goods were stopped and detained on 27.04.2024. Thereafter , a\nstatement was taken from the driver of the conveyances, in FORM GST MOV-01 on 27.04.2024. After\nrecording the statement, the 2nd respondent issued FORM GST MOV -10 dated 01.05.2024, invoking the\nprovisions of Section 130 of the CGST  Act. In this notice, the discrepancies which were noticed by the 2nd\nrespondent, were set out, and it was stated that these discrepancies lead to a prima facie  conclusion that the\ntransport of goods was done with an intention to evade tax. Thereafter , objections were submitted by the\npetitioner on 08.05.2024 and the order of confiscation was passed on 25.05.2024. The initiation of the\nproceedings, under Section 130 of the CGST Act, cannot be faulted at that stage. However , the 2nd respondent\nwould have to make good the prima facie  satisfaction that the petitioners were trying to evade tax.\n29. In the objections of 08.05.2024, the petitioner had taken an objection that a general statement that the\ndocuments verified by the 2nd respondent revealed that the transaction is of a suspicious nature without giving\ndetails of the docum ents which were found to be of a suspicious nature and without giving any details as to\nwhy the authority had thought that the said documents were of a suspicious nature. The petitioner had, after\npointing out the lack of reasons/grounds  in the show cause notice had also sought a copy of the enquiry report\non the basis of which it was found that there were discrepancies in relation to the purchase orders produced by\nthe in charge of the conveyance and the e-way bills submitted to the authority . In the order of confiscation,\nvarious details relating to the names of suppliers and the e-way bills which were not available in relation to\nsuch supp lies etc., were included. These details were not available in the show cause notice issued to the\npetitioner . Further , there is no DIN number attached to the order of confiscation dated 25.05.2024.\n30. It is a settled princ iple of law that a show cause notice would have to set out the entire case against the\nnoticee and noticee should be given an opportunity to rebut the same. In that process, the noticee can always\nask for the material on the basis of which the show cause notice has been issued. Any deviation from the\nabove requirement would amount to violation of principles of natural justice. In the present case, the order of\nconfiscation contains various details which were not placed before the petitioners in the show cause notices of\n01.05.2024. The 2nd respondent did not choose to respond to the request of the petitioners for supply of the\nmaterial on the basis of which the show cause notice has been issued would also amount further violation of\nthe principles of natural justice.\n31. The requi rement of every order or communication of the tax authorities to contain a DIN number is found\nin Central  Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs circular bearing No.128/47/2019-GST , dated 23.12.2019.\nThis circu lar does not make any distinction between proceedings/orders commu nicated directly to the dealers\nand procee dings which are uploaded on the portal. The non mention of DIN militates against the validity of\nthe proceedings, dated 25.05.2024.\n32. Accordingly , these writ petitions are allowed and the confiscation order in FORM GST MOV -11 dated 25-\n05-2024 issued by the 2nd respondent vide Ref.No.Z D370524023072S and confiscation order in FORM GSTKAR TIKMOV -11 dated 25-05-2024 issued by the 2nd respondent vide Ref.N o ZD370524023029J are set aside  and the\nmatters are remand ed back to the 2nd respondent for proper adjudication following principles of natural\njustice. There shall be no order as to costs.\n33. As a sequel, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner prays for writ of mandamus declaring the impugned order\nAAAR/AP/04 (GST ) 2020, dated 28-9-2020, passed by the Appellate Authority  for advance ruling as illegal,\narbitrary and to  set aside  the same and pass further appropriate orders.\n2. The petitioner's case briefly is thus:\u2014\n(i) The petitio ner is a proprietary concern and a leading educational institution providing coaching to\nstudents for obtaining educational qualifications  viz., Chartered Accountancy Certificate ('CA'),\nCost and Works Accountancy Certific ate ('ICW A') and their ilk. While so, the petitioner filed\napplication for advance ruling  vide  Form GST ARA - 01 (as per Rule 104(1)) of CGST Act seeking\nruling inter alia on the point wheth er the coaching/training provided by the applicant for students\nfor the above courses conducted by it fall within the wider meaning of the term 'education' and in\nrelation to education and other related aspects. The Advance Ruling Authority (herein after, 'ARA')\nafter elaborate hearing passed its ruling  vide order Master Minds , In re [2020] 117 taxmann.com\n824/82 GST 167 , wherein the ARA held that the applica nt was not eligible for the exemption under\nEntry No. 66(a) of Notification No. 12/2017-CT(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, as amended. It also gave\nrulings on the other related issues raised by the petitioner before it.\n(ii) Aggrieved by the above rulings, the petitioner filed appeal before the appellate authority for\nadvance ruling and after hearing, the appellate authority dismissed the appea l on 28-9-2020 by\nconfirming the rulings made by the ARA. Aggrieved, the present writ petition is filed by the\npetitioner .\n3. Heard the arguments of learned counsel for petitioner , Sri Y. Sreenivasa Reddy and Sri Suresh Kumar\nRouthu, learned Senior Standing Counsel for CBIC and learned Government  Pleader for Commercial Tax\nrepresenting for the respondents.\n4. (a) The main plank of argument of learned counsel for petitioner is that even  by the date of filing of\napplication before ARA on 15-12-2020, the GST has already cancelled the registration under GST Act of the\npetitioner and further the Director General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (herein after, 'DGGSTI'),\nVisakhapatnam, had called for certain documents and enquired about the payment of GST on the services\nprovided by the petitioner and the petitioner had submitted the documents called for and also gave the\nstatement submitting that there was no tax on the educational services submitted by him. The copies of\nsummons dated 1-7-2019 and 11-9-2019 were issued to the applicant by the DGGSTI in that regard. Learned\ncounsel would submit that all these facts were succinctly narrated by the petitioner in Para 11 of his\napplication. It was also brought to the notice of ARA that show-cause notice was not issued and no docket\nproceedings were pending against the applicant by the date of its applica tion. Learned counsel would\nstrenuously argue that the above proceedings would indicate that the DGGSTI had already commenced\ninvestigation as against the petitioner even before he filed application before ARA and in that view , in the\nlight of first proviso to sub-section (2) of section 98 of CGST/APGST Act, the ARA should not have admitted\nthe application of the petitioner in view of the pendency of the proceedings. Learned counsel drew the\nattention of this Court to the word 'any proceedings' mentioned in the said proviso and argued that the said\nterm comp rehends within it the investigation also. As such, when the investiga tion proceedings are pending\nagainst the applican t, the application of such applicant shall not be entertained by the ARA in view of the\nembar go created in the aforesaid proviso. To buttress his arguments, learned counsel referred to Section 70 of\nCGST/APGST Act. Besides, he also relied upon the following citations:\n(i) Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling , Karnataka, v. Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers\nFederation Ltd. , In re [2020] 1 15 taxmann.com 59/80 GST 199/2020 (3) TMI 73 .\n(ii) Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling , Gujarat, v. J.K. Papad Industries , In re [2022] 134\ntaxmann.com 315/90 GST 98/2021 (10) TMI 60 .\n(iii) Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling , Maharashtra v. Asstt. Commissioner of SGST  v. Arihant\nEnterprises [2020] 1 16 taxmann.com 455/2019 (1 1) TMI 397 .(b) Learned counsel would submit that since the ARA was already made known that the investigation is\npending against the petitioner , the authority ought not to have admitted his application. However ,\nunfortunately , the primary authority has not only admitted his application but also gave rulings in respect of\nthe questions raised by him. Hence, aggrieved by the said order , the petitioner filed appeal and in the said\nappeal, one of the grounds raised by him is with regard to the error committed  by the ARA in admitting his\napplication in view of the already pending investigation. Learned counsel referred Para 8 of the grounds of\nappeal in this regard. Then, learned counsel referring to the Para 5 of the appellate order , would submit that\nthough the contention raised by the petitioner was mentioned, the appellate authority has not given any\nfinding on the said contention and ultimately dismissed the appeal by confirming the order of the ARA.\nLearned counsel would thus submit that the original order as well as the appellate order are vitiated as they are\nagainst the spirit of the proviso to Section 98(2) of CGST/APGST Act. Learned counsel for petitioner would\nsubmit that subsequent to the disposal of the appeal, the DGGSTI issued show-cause notice dated 9-3-2021\nand the petitioner submitted reply . He would thus pray to set aside  the order  AAR No. 08/AP/GST/2020,\ndated 5-3-2020, passed by the ARA as well as the order AAAR/AP/04(GST)/20 20, dated 28-9-2020 and give\nliberty to the petitio ner to agitate his case on all the legal and factual grounds which are available to him and\nthe investigating authorities may be directed to consider those grounds without reference to the observations\nin the order dated 5-3-2020 of the ARA and the order dated 28-9-2020 of the Appellate Authority .\n5. Learned Senior Standing Counsel filed counter and opposed the writ petition. He would submit that the\norder of the appellate authority is perfectly valid and legal and therefore, there is no requirement to interfere\nwith the same. He prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow?\n7. As can be seen, the main thrust of argument of learned counsel for petitioner is that in view of the\ncommencement of the investigation by the DGGSTI even before the submission of application by the\npetitioner , the ARA ought not to have admitted his application. In this regard, it is apposite to refer to section\n98 of the CGST/AP GST Act, which reads thus:\n\"98. Procedure on receipt of application:\u2014\n(1) On receipt of an application, the Authority shall cause a copy thereof to be forwarded to the\nconcerned of ficer and, if necessary , call upon him to furnish the relevant records:\nProvided  that where any records have been called for by the Authority in any case, such records shall, as\nsoon as possible, be returned to the said concerned of ficer.\n(2) The Authority may, after examining the application and the records called for and after hearing the\napplicant or his authorised representativ e and the concerned officer or his authorised representative, by\norder , either admit or reject the application:\nProvided  that the Authority shall not admit the application where the question raised in the application is\nalready pending or decided in any proce edings in the case of an applicant unde r any of the provisions of\nthis Act:\nProvided further  that no application shall be rejected under this sub-section unless an opportunity of\nhearing has been given to the applicant:\nProvided also that where the application is rejected, the reasons for such rejection shall be specified in\nthe order .\n(3) A copy  of every order made under sub-section (2) shall be sent to the applicant and to the concerned\nofficer.\n(4) Where  an application is admitted under sub-section (2), the Authority shall, after examining such\nfurther material as may be placed before it by the applicant or obtained by the Authority and after\nproviding an opportunity of being heard  to the applicant or his authorised representative as well as to the\nconcerned officer or his authorised repre sentative, pronounce its advance ruling on the question specified\nin the application.\n(5) Where the mem bers of the Authorit y differ on any question on which the advance ruling is sought,\nthey shall state the point or points on which they differ and make a reference to the Appellate Authority\nfor hearing and decision on such question.(6) The Authority shall pronounce its advance ruling in writing within ninety days from the date of\nreceipt of application.\n(7) A copy of the advance ruling pronounced by the Authority duly signed by the members and certified\nin such manner as may be prescribed shall be sent to the applicant, the concerned officer and the\njurisdictional of ficer after such pronouncement.\"\nAs can be seen, section 98(2) of the CGST/APGST says that authority may after examining the application\nand records called for and after hearing the applicant or his authorized representative, by order , either admit or\nreject the application. Thus, the sub-s ection (2) says that after hearing the petitioner or his authorized\nrepresentative, the authority may either admit or reject the application. However , for admitting the application\nof the applicant, a qualification is provided in the form of proviso to the said section. The proviso says that the\nauthority shall not admit the application where the question raised in the application is already pending or\ndecided in any proce edings in the case of an applicant under any of the provisi ons in the said Act. Thus, it is\nneedless to emphasize that the first proviso puts an embar go on the authority of the ARA to admit an\napplication. The said embar go says that where the questions raised in the application are already pending or\ndecided by any proceedings in the case of an applicant under any of the provisio ns of the CGST/APGST Act,\nthe authority shall not admit the applic ation. The submission of the petitioner herein is that the phrase 'any\nproceedings' encompasses the investigat ion of an application under the provisions of the Act. To buttress his\nargument, the petitioner referred to section 70 of the APGST Act, which reads thus:\n\"70. Power to summon persons to give evidence and produce documents .\u2014(1) The proper officer under\nthis Act shall have power to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary either to give\nevidence or to produce a document or any other thing in any inquiry in the same manner , as provided in\nthe case of a civil court under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act No. 5 of 1908).\n(2) Every such inquiry referred to in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be a \"judicial proceedings\" within\nthe meaning of Section 193 and Section 228 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. (Act No. 45 of 1860)\"\nAs per the said section, the proper officer under this Act shall have the power to summon any person either to\ngive evidence or to produce a document or any other thing in any inquiry in the same manner , as provided in\nthe case of a civil court under the provis ions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such enquiry referred to in sub-\nsection (1) shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the\nIndian Penal Code. Thus, the proceedings conducted by the investigating authority under the provisions of this\nAct shall be construed as judicial proceedings as per the CGST/APGST Act.\n8. In Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling , Karnataka's  case (supra 1), the appellate authority for ARA,\nKarnataka was inter alia consideri ng the argument of the department that the respondent/applicant therein\nsuppressed the factum of investigation that has been initiated by the DGGSTI under the CGST Act and its\nfiling incidental report dated 17-1-2019 and obtained the ruling from authority for advance ruling by keeping\nthe said authority in darkness and therefore, the said ruling was invalid and void ab initio . In that context,\nlearned appellate authority for Advance Ruling, Karnataka has observed thus:\n\"6.1. The Appellant submitted that it was brought to their notice by the DGGI, Bangalore Zone Unit, that\nM/s. KCM PFL (the applicant-respondent) had suppressed vital facts in the application made before the\nAuthority for Advance Ruling about the investigations that had been initiated  by the DGGI under the\nCGST Act, 2017; that investigation was initiated by the Central authority Directorate General of GST\nIntelligence, Bangal ore against the applicant and incident report was issued on 17-1-2019; that this fact\nof investigations conducted by DGGI against the applicant was not brought to the notice of the Authority;\nthat the Advance Ruling thus obtained by keeping the Authority for Advance Ruling in the dark appears\nto be not a legal and correct order and therefore it should be appealed against as the subject order of the\nAuthority appears to be invalid ab initio . They referred to the proviso to Section  98(2) of the CGST Act\nwhich states that advance ruling cannot be obtained when investigations have been initiated; that it has\nbeen brought to their notice that a number of cases have been booked by DGGI across India and in some\ncases the taxpayers have admitted the stand of the Department and made the payments of differential tax.\nThe Appe llant submitted that since huge revenue is at stake, the ruling of the lower Authority should be\nheld as void ab initio .\n** ** **15. It becomes clear from the above that the respondent KCMPFL made an application for advance ruling\non 20th March, 2019 all the while being  aware of the investigation being conducted against them by the\nDGGI, Bangalore. The respondent KCMPFL chose to keep this fact away from the Authority for\nAdvance Ruling at the time of filing the application. The application for advance ruling could not have\nbeen made in this case as it is hit by the provisions of section 98 (2) of the CGST Act in as much as an\ninvestigation was already initiated against them by DGGI on the very same issue that was raised before\nthe Authority for Advance Ruling. We therefore hold that the order of the lower Authority is void ab\ninitio  as it was vitiated by the provisions of section 98(2) of the CGST Act.\"\n9. In Appellate Authority  for Advance Ruling, Gajarat's  case (supra 2) also, the appellat e authority for\nadvance ruling, Gujarat was dealing with the term 'any proceedings' mentioned in Section 98(2) of CGST Act.\nIn this context, the said authority has observed thus:\n\"17. The appellant has contended that the proceedings under section 67 or Chapter XIV of the CGST Act,\n2017 are not covered under the term 'proceedings' used in the first proviso to sub-section (2) of section 98\nof the CGST Act, 2017. We find that this contention of the appellant is not borne out from the plain\nreading of the said proviso. As per the said proviso, the authority shall not admit the application where\nthe question raised in the application is already pedning or decided in any proceedings in the case of an\napplicant under any of the provisions of this Act. The term 'any' used in the said proceedings in the case\nof an applicant under any of the phrase 'the provisions of this Act' leaves no room for any doubt and\nmake it amply clear  that the scope of the proviso is wide and it covers any proceedings under any of the\nprovisions of the CGST Act, 2017 with the conditions that such proceedings should be related to the\nquestion raised in the application and such proceedings should be in the case of the applicant. In the\npresent case, the proceedings initiated by the DGGI, Surat was in the case of the appellant and it was\nprecisely related to the question raised in the application filed before the GAAR. Therefore, the\napplication of the appellant could not have been admitted by the GAAR in view of the first proviso to\nsub-section (2) of section 98 of the CGST Act, 2017.\"\n10. In Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling, Maharashtra's  case (supra 3 ), the learned Appellate Authority\nfor Advance Ruling, Maharastra, was considering the ef fect of commencement of the investigation prior to the\nsubmission of application by an applica nt before the concerned advance ruling authority . In that context, it\nwas observed thus:\n\"165. Thus, it is seen from the above facts of the case that investigations proceedings were approved on\n15-1-2019 and the search was conducted on 5-2-2019. The statement of the Director of KOTI u/s 70 was\nrecorded on 5-2-201 9, and the statement of M/s Srinivas Kamath (Wholetime Director of KOTI) was\nrecorded on 11-2-2019. The application for advance ruling was filed on 25-2-2019 by the applicant\nrespondent at the behest of KOTI. It becomes clear from the above that there was a deliberate intention\non the part of KOTI as well as its applicant-respondent to obtain a decision clandestinely without\nrevealing the issue of investigation being initiated against KOTI on the very same issue that was raised\nbefore the ARA.\"\nThe authority has ultimately  set aside  the order passed by the ARA declaring the same as void ab initio .\n11. Thus, the above jurisprudence tells us that any proceedings referred to in 98(2) proviso encompasses\nwithin it the investig ation against the applicant as per the provisions of CGST/A PGST Act and if by the date\nof filing of the application before the ARA, already such proceedings were commenced, the ARA shall not\nadmit the application inviting advance ruling. Learned Senior counsel for respondent has not placed any\ncontra citations before us to hold any other view .\n12. Coming to the instant case, summons were issued to the petitioner on 1-7-2019 by Senior Intelligence\nOfficer, DGGSTI and the panchanama was recorded on 1-7-2019. Copy of panchnama proceedings filed\nalong with the writ petition contains a detailed examination of the petitioner by the Senior Intelligence\nOfficer. The question numbers 9 to 16 relate to the courses conducted by the petitioner , the registration of the\npetitioner institution under GST Act and its payment of tax etc. particulars, which can be said to be\nconcerning to the provisions of the CGST/APGST Act. Therefore, it can be said that the investigation was\ncommenced even prior to the filing of the application by the petitioner before ARA.\n13. Havi ng regard to the legal position that when investigation has already commenced prior to the filing of\napplication, the ARA shall not admit the application as per proviso to sub-section (2) of section 98, we are of\nthe view that the ARA should not have admitted the application in the instant case and issued its ruling.GKTherefore, the said order dated 5-3-2020 is vitiated by law. This fact was brought to the notice of the appellate\nauthority in the grounds of appeal. Though the said ground is mentioned, unfortunately , the appellate authority\nhas not given its finding on the said ground raised by the petitioner . Therefo re, the order of the appellate\nauthority is also vitiated by law. Hence,  we find force in the submission of learned counsel for petitioner that\nboth the orders are liable to be set aside.\n14. Accordingly , this writ petition is allowed and the order dated 5-3-2020 of ARA  and order dated 28-9-2020\nof the appellate authority are set aside  and the petitioner is given liberty to appear before the appropriate\nauthority and submit his explanation and to take all factual and legal pleas that are permissible under law and\nthe said authority shall consider and proceed in accordance with law without being influenced by the orders\npassed by the ARA and appellate authority . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

Narendra Chetty , learned counsel for the petitioner and learned\nGovernment Pleader for Commercial Taxes and with their consent the Writ Petition is disposed off at the\nadmission stage.\n2. The Order of Assessment No. ZH370720OD77052, dated 9-7-2020 and the Rectification Order , dated 25-7-\n2020 passed by the respondent no. 1 under the A.P.G.S.T . Act, 2017, for the Tax periods July, 2017 to June,\n2019, imposing Tax, Penalty and Interest as violative of principles of natural justice, the present Writ Petition\ncame to be filed.\n3. The averments made in the af fidavit filed, in support of the W rit Petition, are that:-KAR TIK(a) The petitio ner execu ted certain works entrusted to it by M/s. TATA Projects Limited, and issued\nTax Invoices to M/s. TATA Projects Limited. It is said that as per the terms of the agreement, the\nsaid Contractee has to pay Service Tax on the same to the petitioner on issue of Tax Invoices by the\npetitioner . Though, the petitioner issued  Tax Invoices, the Contractee failed to pay G.S.T . amounts\nto the petitioner and withheld the same due to which the petitioner could not file its returns and pay\nthe T axes as the G.S.T . Portal will not accept the returns unless accompanied by payment of T axes.\n(b) It is said that the total G.S.T . liability for the works executed for the petitioner during the tax period\nis about Rs. 1,85,84,695/-. A Garnis hee Notice dated 11-9-2020, came to be issued to the\nContractor stating that the petitioner has failed to pay Taxes, Penalty and Intere st under the G.S.T .\nAct and directed them to pay the said amount. On coming to know abou t the order of the\nAssessment passed by the authority , the petitioner filed the present Writ Petition mainly on the\nground that an opportunity of hearing should have been granted to the petitioner in terms of sub-\nsection (4) of section 75 of the SGST Act, 2017. He placed reliance on the judgment of this Court\nin Ocean Sparkle Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) [2021] 129 taxmann.com 186 (AP)  in\nsupport of the same.\n4. Sri G. Narendra Chetty, learned counsel for the petitioner though raised various grounds would submit that\nsince no opportunity  of hearing was given, the matter to be remanded back to the Assessing Authority as it\ncame to be passed in violation of principles of natural justice.\n5. Sri Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes, would submit that though the\nAssessment Order was passed in the month of July, 2020, the petitioner did not approach this Court within a\nreasonable time. He further submits that he approached this Court only after issuance of Garnishee Notice and\nlong there after, the present Writ Petition is filed. He further submits that having regard to the orders passed by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court, extending the period of limitation, the petitioner can avail the remedy of appeal as\nprovided under section 107 of the C.G.S.T . Act, 2017\n6. It is no doubt true that the order was passed in the month of July, 2020 and the Writ Petition was filed in the\nmonth of October , 2021. The reason given by the petitioner is that due to pandemic, he could not avail the\nremedy at the earlie st. He further submits that in view of the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nextending the period of limitation, approaching this Court in the year 2021 cannot be said to be with delay .\nInfact, in W.P.No.9162 of 2021 relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner , similar such objection\nwas raised, but the same was not accept ed having regard to the violation of section 74 of C.G.S.T . Act, which\nwe will discuss now .\n7. Sub-section (4) of section 75 of the Act, reads as under:-\n\"An opportunity of hearing shall be granted where a request is received in writing from the person\nchargeable with tax or penalty , or where any adverse decision is contemplated against such person.\"\n8. It is very much evident that an opportunity of hearing is required to be given where a request was made in\nwriting to the person chargeable with taxes and penalty or where any adverse decision is contemplated against\nsuch person. Therefore, when the authority contemplates to pass an adverse order against any assessee, an\nopportunity of hearing is required to be given. Failure to do so, in our view , amounts to violation of principles\nof natural justice. In the instant case, admittedly no notice was given to the petitioner before contemplating to\npass an adverse order. Such a course of caution is prejudicial to the interest of assessee and the same would be\nin violation of sub-section (4) of section 75 of C.G.S.T . Act, 2017.\n9. For the above said reasons, the Writ Petition is allowed, setting aside the Assessment Order No. No.\nZH370720OD77052, dated 9-7-2020 and the Rectification Order , dated 25-7-2 020 passed by the respondent\nno. 1 under the G.S.T. Act, 2017, and remanding the matter to respondent no. 1 for consideration of the issues\nand for passing appropriate orders in accordance with law afresh after giving notice of hearing to the\npetitioner . It is needless to mention that on the date so fixed either the petitioner or his authorized\nrepresentative shall be present before the respondent no. 1 for personal hearing. The entire exercise of giving\nnotice, hearing and passing of the order should takes place as early as possible preferably within a period of\nfour (4) weeks from the date of receipt of this order . There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , shall stand closed.*Matter remanded."}

We\nhave perused the material record.\n3. Accordin g to the case of the petitioner , the petitioner made an attempt for online submission of Form GST\nTRAN-1; but, the petitioner could not file the TRAN-1 due to technical glitches and that the petitioner's\nrepresentations were not considered by the respondents, and hence, the present writ petition is filed.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner , having drawn the attention of this Court to the of a Coordinate Bench of\nthis Court passed in Lantech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Pr. CIT [2019] 111 taxmann.com 144/31 GSTL  392\n(AP) , submits that the issue involved in the present writ petition is squarely covered by the aforesaid order .\n5. How ever, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India contended that the pleading of the petitioner itself\nindicates that the petitioner could not file Form GST TRAN-1 electronically and that the petitioner could not\nproduce any screen shot evidencing the fact that a genuine attempt was made for submission of the Form GST\nTRAN-1 within the time allowed under law .\n6. However , it is also submitted that time is extended till 31.12.2019 for filing Form GST TRAN-1\nelectronically .\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner in reply would submit that at the relevant point of time, the GST system\nwas in a trial and error phase and that not only the petitioner but several other dealers like the petitioner were\nunable to even connect to the system on account of network & other failures and that such situation is\nrecognised by various High Courts and that therefore, the petitioner's request merits consideration.\n8.

The averments made in the af fidavit filed in support of the writ petition, are as under:-\n(a) The petitioner is a registered dealer , intended with GST and is on the rolls of first respondent doing\nbusiness in MDF Boards and Writing Slates. The first respondent conducted inspection on the\nbusiness premises of the petitioner on 4-11-2020 and thereafter issued Show Cause notice dated 6-\n8-2021, proposing to restrict ITC for the tax period 2019-20 at Rs. 9,41,624/- [as against Rs.\n18,82,220/-]. On receipt of Show Cause notice, the petitioner paid the amount as demanded in\nShow Cause notice of Rs.10,78,074/- by reversing the ITC claim as it has not utilized the ITC and\nthe same is lying to its credit in the Electronic Credit Ledger .\n(b) It is the case of the petitioner that as Input Tax Credit claim was not utilized and was lying in the\nElectronic Ledger , it has reversed the same and there was no 'net cash liability' on the petitioner .\nHence, all proceedings pursuant to the Show Cause notice shall be deemed to have been closed.\n(c) However , the first respondent issued Show Cause notice dated 6-10-2021, stating that the petitioner\nhas paid only the Tax and not interest under section 50 of the GST Act, and as such, the petitioner\nhas to pay interest, and penalty under section 122(2) of GST Act. Objections to the said Show\nCause notice came to be submitted  vide letter dated 29-11-2021, stating that as per the instructions\nof the Audit Officer, the petitioner has reversed the ITC and dischar ged liability through DRC-03.\nAccording to him, payment of interest would arise if it has utilized the credit  and as long as the\ncredit is not utilized, payment of interest does not arise. The impugned order came to be passed\nrejecting the objections of the petitioner , which lead to filing of the present writ petition.\n3. Sri G. Narendra Chetty, learned counsel for the petitioner mainly submits that section 50 of the CGST Act,\n2017, which was amended with retrospective ef fect, came into ef fect from 1-7-2017. Therefore, the interest on\nthe same is chargeable only on 'net tax liability' i.e. if any tax is payable/paid after adjusting the Input Tax\nCredit available to the dealer . He relied upon various judgments of different High Courts in support of his\ncase. He also relies to a Common Order  passed by this Court on 2-3-2022 in W.P.Nos.8734 and 8768 of 2020,\nwherein it was held that in view of the amended section 50 of CGST Act, 2017 with retrospective effect,\ninterest is liable only on 'net tax liability' and not on the 'gross tax liability'. He further submits that the ITC\nclaim was lying in Electronic Credit Ledger of the petitioner and since it was not utilized, he got it reversed\npursuant to the same being pointed out by the first respondent in the Audit. Hence, pleads that the order\npassed under challenge requires interference.\n4. On the other hand, Sri Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Government Pleader for respondent nos.1 and 2, would\nsubmit that since the order is appealable under section 107 of CGST Act, 2017, entertaining a writ petition by\nthe High Court may not be proper . In other words, he would submit that the petitioner ought to have availed\nthe efficacious, alternative remedy , available under the Act. He relies upon the judgment of Asstt.\nCommissioner (CT) LTU v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. [2020] 116 taxmann.com 417/36\nGSTL 305 (SC)/[2020] 19 SCC 681 in support of the same.\n5. A perusal  of section 50 of CGST Act, 2017 shows that there was an amendmen t to section 50 of the CGST\nAct, which came into effect from 1-6-2021. A reading of section 50 of CGST Act coupled with the\namendment would show that every person who is liable to pay tax in accordan ce with the provisions of this\nAct or the rules made thereunder , but fails to pay the tax or any part thereof to the Government within the\nperiod prescribed, shall for the period for which the tax or any part thereof remains unpaid, pay, on his own,\ninterest at such rate, not exceeding eighteen percent, as recommended by the Government.\n6. Proviso to Sub-section (1) of section 50 of CGST Act, 2017 states as under:-\n\"Interest on tax payable in respect of supplies made during a tax period and declared in the return for the\nsaid period furnished after the due date in accordance with the provisions of section 39, except where\nsuch return is furnished after commencement of any proceedings under section 73 or section 74 in respect\nof the said period, shall be levied on that portion of the tax that is paid by debiting the electronic cash\nledger\".\n7. Prima facie , it appears that proviso to section 50 of CGST Act was amended for payment of interest on 'net\ntax liabilit y' in case of delay in payment of tax declaring monthly returns. As held by the Authority in the\norder impugned, interest will be levied on cash payments made for the return of taxes. The tax determinedafter initiation of proceedings under section 73 of CGST Act, for determination  of tax in pursuance of Audit\nconducted under section 71 of the CGST Act, the benefit of payment of interest only on cash payment is not\navailable, and interest is payable even if assessed tax is paid out of credit available to the petitioner .\n8. The arguments advanced in so far as the payment of interest is concerned, in our view , can be adjudicated\non a perus al of credit and cash ledgers, more so, when a finding is given by the authority that the assesse did\nnot declare the correct output tax liability in their GSTR-3B returns. At this stage, it is also to be noticed\nagainst the order impugned an appeal lies under section 107 of CGST Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nGlaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Car e Ltd.  [supra 1 cited] has categorically held as under:-\n'21. Relian ce was then placed on a three -Judge Bench decision of this Court in ITC Ltd.  v. Union of India\n[ITC Ltd. v. Union of India , (1998) 8 SCC 610] . In that case, the High Court had dismissed the writ\npetition on the groun d that the petitioner  therein had an adequate alternative remedy by way of an appeal\nunder section 35 of the Central Excise Act. Concededly , this Court was pleased  to uphold that opinion of\nthe High Court. However , whilst consi dering the difficulty expressed by the petitioner therein that the\nstatutory remedy of appeal had now become time-barred during the pendency of the proceedings before\nthe High Court and before this Court, the Court permitted the petitioner there in to resort to remedy of\nstatutory appeal and directed the appell ate authority to decide the appeal on merits. This obviously was\ndone on the basis of concession given by the counsel appearing for the Revenu e as noted in para 2(1) of\nthe order , which reads thus : (SCC pp. 610-1 1)\n\"2. The High Court has dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner on the ground that there is an\nadequate alternative remedy by way of an appeal under section 35 of the Centra l Excise Act. The learned\ncounsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner will face certain dif ficulties in pursuing this remedy:\n(1) This remedy may not be any longer available to it because the appeal has to be filed within a period of\nthree months from the date of the assess ment order and delay can be condoned only to the extent of three\nmore months by the Collector under section 35 of the Act. It is pointed out that the petitioner did not file\nan appeal because the Collector (Appeal) at Madras had taken a view in a similar matter that an appeal\nwas not maintainable. That apart, the petitioner in view of the huge demand involved filed a writ petition\nand so did not file an appeal. In the circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the ends of\njustice will be met if we permit the petitioner to file a belated appeal within one month from today with\nan application for condonation of delay , whereon the appeal may be entertained. The learned counsel for\nthe Revenue has stated before us that the Revenue will not object to the entert ainment of the appeal on\nthe ground that it is barred by time. In view of this direction and concession, the petitioner will have an\neffective alternative remedy by way of an appeal.\"\n(Emphasis Supplied)\nIn that case, it appears that the writ petition was filed within statutory period and legal remedy was being\npursued in good faith by the assessee (appellant).'\n9. Further , in Asstt. CST v. Commer cial Steel Ltd. [2021] 130 taxmann.com 180/52 GSTL 385/88 GST 799,\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Court can entertain a writ petition under article 226 of Constitution\nof India in exceptional circumstances where there is:\n(i) a breach of fundamental rights;\n(ii) a violation of the principles of natural justice;\n(iii) an excess of jurisdiction; or\n(iv) a challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated legislation.\n10. In the present case, none of the above exceptions are established. The only question is as to whether the\nauthorities were right in directing the petitioner for payment of interest on the disputed tax and the penalty\nthereof. As seen from the order impug ned, original tax to an extent of Rs. 36,72,034/- was assessed, but\nhowever , the petitioner is said to have paid Rs. 25,93,960/- in DRC-03 pursuan t to Show Cause notice issued\non 6-8-2021. The petitioner is said to have paid the said amount on 6-9-2021. The question now is whether the\npetitioner is liable to pay interest on the tax amount of Rs. 25,93,960/-paid before issuance of Show Cause\nnotice and on Rs. 10,78,074/- paid after the issuance of Show Cause notice. Since an appeal provision is\navailable, and taking into consideration the findings given by the Assessing Authority , more so, when theSBfinding by the Assessing Authority is to the effect that the assesse is under an obligation to restrict input tax\ncredit to the extent of exempt supplies every month and reverse the same in their GSTR-3B returns, but failed\nto do so and utilized such ineligible credit to dischar ge output tax liability , withholding the payment of tax by\nthe due date, couple d with the finding given with regard to payment of interest , we feel that in the fitness, it\nwould be just and proper , the petitioner avails the remedy of appeal where all the issues can be agitated.\n11. In view of the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is disposed of. Howev er, the petitioner can take\nadvantage of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in calculating the limitation and the pendency of Writ\nPetition before this Court while filing the appeal. There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

As seen from the record, the petitioner  herein is a Works Contractor , engaged in business of execution of\ncontracts, manufacturing or sale of machinery and general goods. The petitione r company also manufactures\nindustrial products like gears, centrifugals, castings and gauges. After bifurc ation of the State of Andhra\nPradesh, the petitioner became a registe red dealer in the State of Andhra Prade sh under the provisions of the\nAndhra Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2005 with effect from 31-8-2014 and is on the rolls of respondent No.\n1.\nThe petitio ner is said to have received a work order from Ministry of Defence (R&D), Government of India,\n\"Aakanksha\" Development Enclave, Rao Tularam Marg, New Delhi - 110 010 on 8-8-201 1 for execution of\naggregation work on defence vessels, S3 & S4, in line with the technical specifications given by the\nDepartment of Defence, New Delhi. In terms of the work order , the bills are to be raised in the name of\nProgramme Director , Headquarters ATVP, New Delhi. The orders were to be executed in terms of the contract\nand on the instructions of Advance Technology , Vessel Programme Wing of the Ministry of Defence, New\nDelhi. The works/se rvices have been executed at the site i.e., The Project Director , Ship Building Centre,\nVaruna Block, Goda vari Gate, Scindia Road, Naval Base Post, Visakhapatnam. In terms of the contract, the\npayments were to be released from the Ministry of Defence, New Delhi based on the completion of work from\nstage to stage. The petitioner executed the works/services as per the terms of the contract in the recipient's\nlocation at Visakhap atnam. As the impu gned transactions are interstate transactions, the petitioner collected\nIntegrated Goods & Services Tax (for short, \"I.G.S.T .\") from the recipient and remitted the same to the\nGovernment. In the present transaction, the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in two dif ferent\nstates. The petitioner , in terms of section 7 of the I.G.S.T . Act, collected I.G.S.T . and remitted the same to the\nexchequer .\nHowever , on 15-11-2018, respondent No. 1 issued a show cause notice proposing to treat the transactions as\nintrastate supply of goods instead of interstate supply of goods. Objections came to be made by the petitioner\non the said proposal s through letters, dated 22-2-2019 and 27-3-2019. Without considering the same, on 5-10-\n2020, respondent No. 1 is said to have completed the assessment treating the transaction as an intra-State\nsupply of goods and levied Central Goods & Services Tax (for short, \"C.G.S.T .\") and Andhra Pradesh State\nGoods & Services Tax (for short, \"S.G.S.T\"). In view of the above, the petitioner requested the authorities\nvide letter , dated 27-3-2019, to adjust the monies paid under I.G.S.T . towards the dues payable under C.G.S.T .\nand S.G.S.T . but the same came to be rejected by respondent No. 1. Hence, an appeal came to be preferred\nbefore respondent No. 2, which was also dismissed  vide order , dated 30-12-2 021, against which, the present\nwrit petition  came to be filed.\n4. Though various grounds are raised, learned counsel for the petitioner mainly submits that when the nature\nof transaction is admitted, the authoritie s ought to have adjusted the amount paid by him towards I.G.S.T . In\nany event, he would contend that he will pay the C.G.S.T . and S.G.S.T . due to the authorities and thereafter ,\nhe may be permitted to claim refund of the amount paid towards I.G.S.T .\n5. The same is not seriously opposed by the learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax.\n6. Even in the assessment order , dated 5-10-2020, passed by respondent No. 1/Assistant Commissioner (ST),\nKurupam Market Circle, Visakhapatnam , it is held that the office cannot make adjustment of I.G.S.T . into\nC.G.S.T . and S.G.S.T . The taxable person may claim refund of I.G.S.T . after payment of C.G.S.T . & S.G.S.T .\nand in view of the same, the objections filed by the taxable person were held not tenable.\n7. Having regard to the above and in view of the fact that the nature of transa ction is not in dispute, the\npresent Writ Petition  is dispose d of directing the petitioner to pay C.G.S.T . and S.G.S.T . within a period of\nthree (3) weeks from  today and thereafter , make a claim for refund of the amount under I.G.S.T ., which the\npetitioner is entitled to, before responde nt No. 1, in which event, respondent No. 1 shall deal with the same as\nearly as possible, preferably , within a period of four (4) weeks thereafter . There  shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions  pending, if any , in this Writ Petition  shall stand closed.*In favour of revenue."}

No.\n10350 of 2020, wherein this Court dismissed the Writ Petition confirm ing the Order of the Joint\nCommissioner (ST), Appellate Authority under GST Act, Vijayawada, who in turn upheld the Order of the\nAssistant Commissioner (ST), Circle-II Division, Suryaraopeta, V ijayawada.\n2. The review petitioner is the writ petitioner and the respondents are the respondents in the writ petition.\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondents.\n4. The grounds for review are that the imposition of penalty  by the authorities is not automatic and the same\ncan be imposed only when there is a fraud or willful intention to defraud the revenue and there is no finding in\nthe origina l rejection order dated 19-9-2 018 to the effect that the petitioner opted  for composite scheme with a\nfraudulent intention to defraud the reven ue and the same was confirmed in the appeal  vide order dated 12-2-\n2020.\n5. But in the writ petition, a comprehensive relief was sought challenging the proceedings of the 3rd\nrespondent as confirmed by the 2nd respondent  vide order dated 12-2-2020 wherein the petitioner was levied\nwith tax and imposition of penalty  with interest.\n6. To touch the facts in brief, the petitio ner was a Proprietrix doing business in furniture with necessary\npermission and licenses from the concerned Departments including erstwhile Sales Tax Department. After\nGST Act came into force the petitioner became the registered dealer with GST Registration No.\n37AABP A9728J1ZJ with effect from 1-7-2017. The petitioner opted for payment of tax under composite\nscheme under section 10(1) of the GST Act and started filing GST returns and Form GSTR-IV from the\nquarter ending September , 2017 by paying 1% GST on the turnover . But the 3rd respondent  vide show cause\nNotice dated 14-2-2018 rejected the claim of the petitioner under the composite scheme on the ground that the\nturnover of the petitioner for the \"previous year\" under the VAT regime was Rs. 2.09 crores. Even after the\nexplanation was given by the petitioner , the same was rejected on 26-7-2018 in Form-GSTCMP-07. Then\nanother show cause notice dated 27-7-2018 was issued in terms of section 74 and Section 10(5) of the State\nGST Act informing the petitioner his liability to pay State GST at the rate of 14% and Central GST at the rate\nof 14% from the date of initial registration i.e., from 1-7-2017 and demanded payment of Rs. 15,93,708/-with\ninterest and penalty  vide proceedings of the 3rd respondent dated  19-9-2018. In an appeal of the petitione r, the\nsame was confirmed by the 2nd respondent while rejecting the appeal on 12-2-2020. Against which, the above\nwrit petition was filed.\n7. On considering the matter on merits, this Court declared that for the purpose of financial year 2017-2018\nunder GST regime is concerned, the preceding financial year would be 2016-2017 under the VAT regime for\nthe purpose of collection of tax under the GST Act, 2017 and held that the petitioner is not entitled for the\nbenefit under the composite scheme for collection of taxes and penalty  and confirmed the findings of the\nauthorities concerned,  vide its order dated 11-11-2020. The said order of the writ petition dated 11-11-2020 is\nnow sought to be reviewed by the petitioner .\n8. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondents imposed 100% penalty  invoking section\n74 of the GST Act instead of invoking section 73 of the GST Act by imposing penalty  of lesser percentage in\nthe normal circumstances other than in the case of fraud or willful intention to defraud the revenue. As per\nsection 74 of the said Act the petitioner had to pay equal amount of tax towards penalty  on the finding of\nwillful intention to defraud the revenue. Section 10(5) of the said Act deals with penalty  and the ingredients of\nsections 73 and 74 of the GST Act would apply equally for the purpose of Section 10 of the said Act. Since\nthe quantum of penalty  is heavy under section 74 of the Act, the petitioner seeks reduction of the same under\nsection 73 of the Act, for which this review petition is filed.\n9. The learned counsel for the petitioner also relies upon the decision of the Hon' ble Apex Court Continental\nFoundation Joint Ventur e v. CCE 2007 taxmann.com 532, in Paras 11, 12, 14 and 15 which arose under the\nprovisions of Central Excise Act, 1944, in support of his plea.\n10. On the other hand, the learned Government Pleader would submit that the authorities rightly rejected the\nclaim of the petitioner under the composite scheme and levied the tax and penalty  with interest under section\n74 of the GST Act. According to him, on considering the matter on merits this Court dismissed the Writ\nPetition in toto and as such it cannot be reviewed basing on the grounds raised by the petitioner .11. Befo re dealing with the case on hand,  it would be appropriate to refer to the authorities on the subject,\nnamely , scope of review by the High Court in an application filed under Order XLVII rules 1 and 2 read with\nsection 1 14 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\n12. In Haridas Das v. Usha Rani Banik  [2006] 4 SCC 78, the Hon'ble Suprem e Court in paragraph No. 13\nheld as under:-\n'13. In order to appreciate the scope of a review , Section 114 CPC has to be read, but this section does not\neven adum brate the ambit of interferenc e expected of the court since it merely  states that it \"may make\nsuch order thereon as it thinks fit\". The parameters are prescribed in Order 47 CPC and for the purposes\nof this lis, permit the defendant to press for a rehearing \"on account of some mistake or error apparent on\nthe face of the records or for any other sufficient reason\". The former part of the rule deals with a\nsituation attributable to the applicant, and the latter to a jural action which is manifestly incorrect or on\nwhich two conclusions are not possible. Neither of them postulate a rehearing of the dispute because a\nparty had not highlighted all the aspects of the case or could perhaps have argued them more forcefully\nand/or cited binding precedents to the court and thereby enjoyed a favourable verdict. This is amply\nevident from the Explanation  to Rule 1 of Order 47 which states that the fact that the decision on a\nquestion of law on which the judgment of the court is based has been reversed or modified by the\nsubsequent decision  of a superior court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such\njudgment. Where the order in question is appealable the aggrieved party has adequate and efficacious\nremedy and the court should exercise the power to review its order with the greatest circumspection. This\nCourt in Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Govt. of A.P. [(1964) 5 SCR 174 : AIR 1964 SC 1372] held as\nfollows: (SCR p. 186)\n\"[T]here is a distinction which is real, though it might not always be capable of exposition, between a\nmere erron eous decision and a decision which could be characterised as vitiated by 'error apparent'. A\nreview is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but\nlies only for patent error . \u2026 where without any elaborate argument one could point to the error and say\nhere is a substantial point of law whic h stares one in the face, and there could reasonably be no two\nopinions entertained about it, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out.\"'\n13. The Hon'b le Suprem e Court in Gopal Singh  v. State Cadr e Forest Officers Association  [2007] 9 SCC 369\nheld that, after rejecting the original application filed by the appellant, there was no justification for the\nTribunal to review its order and allowed the revision of the appellant. Some of the observations made in are\nextracted below:\n\"40. The learned counsel for the State also pointed out that there was no necessi ty whatsoever on the part\nof the Tribunal to review its own judgment. Even after the microscopic examination of the judgment of\nthe Tribun al we could not find a single reason in the whole judgment as to how the review was justified\nand for what reason s. No apparent error on the face of the record was point ed, nor was it discussed.\nThereby the Tribunal sat as an appellate authority over its own judgmen t. This was completely\nimpermissible and we agree with the High Court (Sinha, J.) that the Tribunal has travelled out of its\njurisdiction to write a second order in the name of reviewing its own judgment. In fact the learned\ncounsel for the appellant did not address us on this very vital aspect.\"\nThe principles which can be culled out from the abovenoted judgments are:\n\"i. The power of the Tribunal to review its order/decision under section 22(3)( f) of the Act is\nakin/analogous to the power of a civil court under section 114 read with Order 47 rule 1\nCPC.\nii. The Tribunal can review its decision on either of the grounds enumerated in Order 47 Rule\n1 and not otherwise.\niii. The expression \"any other sufficient reason\" appearing in Order 47 Rule 1 has to be\ninterpreted in the light of other specified grounds.\niv. An error which is not self-evident and which can be discovered by a long process of\nreasoning, cannot be treated as an error apparent on the face of record justifying exercise of\npower under section 22(3)( f).\nv. An erroneous order/decision cannot be corrected in the guise of exercise of power ofreview .\nvi. A decision /order cannot be reviewed under section 22(3)( f) on the basis of subsequent\ndecision/judgment of a coordinate or lar ger Bench of the tribunal or of a superior court.\nvii. While considering an application for review, the tribunal must confine its adjudication with\nreference to material which was available at the time of initial decision. The happening of\nsome subsequent event or development cannot be taken note of for declaring the initial\norder/decision as vitiated by an error apparent.\nviii. Mere disco very of new or important matter or evidence is not sufficient ground for review .\nThe party 33 seeking review has also to show that such matter or evidence was not within\nits knowle dge and even after the exercis e of due diligence, the same could not be produced\nbefore the court/tribunal earlier .\"\n14. Further , the Hon'b le Supreme Court in Ram Sahu  v. Vinod Kumar Rawat  2020 SCC Online SC 896,\nreviewed the entire case law on the subject and held in paragraph No. 34 as under:\n\"34. To appreciate the scope of review , it would be proper for this Court to discuss the object and ambit\nof section 114 CPC as the same is a substantive provision for review when a person considering himself\naggrieved either by a decree or by an order of Court from which appeal is allowed but no appeal is\npreferred or where there is no provision for appeal against an order and decree,  may apply for review of\nthe decree or order as the case may be in the Court, which may order or pass the decree. From the bare\nreading of section 114 CPC, it appears that the said substantive power of review under section 114 CPC\nhas not laid down any condition as the condition precedent in exercise of power of review nor the said\nSection imposed any prohibition on the Court for exercising its power to review its decision. However , an\norder can be reviewed by a Court only on the prescribed grounds mentioned in Order 47 rule 1 CPC,\nwhich has been elaborately discussed hereinabove. An application for review is more restricted than that\nof an appeal and the Court of review has limited jurisdiction as to the definite limit mentioned in Order\n47 rule 1 CPC itself. The powers of review cannot be exercised as an inherent power nor can an appellate\npower can be exercised in the guise of power of review .\"\n15. This Court in Ku. A. Prabhavathi, W.G. v. State of A.P. Revenue Department  [I.A.No.6 of 2018 in W.P.\nNo.16450 of 2004, dated 8-11-2019], after referring to judgments in T.D. Dayal  v. Madupu Harinarayana\n[2013] 6 AL T 681 (DB) and Mohammadiya Educational Society  v. Union of India  [Writ Petition No. 31371 of\n2015, dated 20-4-2016] held as under:\n\"Review , literally and judicially , means re-examination or reconsideration. The basic philosophy inherent\nin it is the universal acceptance of human fallibility . Yet, in the realm of law, Courts lean strongly in\nfavour of the finality of a decision legall y and properly made. Exceptions have been carved out to correct\naccidental mistakes or to prevent misca rriage of justice or to avoid abuse of process. So, the power of\nreview would be exercised only to remove the error and not to disturb the finality . There are definitive\nlimits to exercise the power of review . The same can be exercised on the discovery of a new and\nimportant matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of\nthe person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made. It\ncan also be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record is found. But, it may\nnot be exercised on the ground that a decision was erroneous on merits. That would be the province of a\nCourt of Appeal. A power of review is not to be confused with the appellate power which may enable an\nAppellate Court to correct all manner of errors committed by the Subord inate Court. The review\nproceeding cannot be equated with the original hearing of the case, and the finality of the judgment\ndelivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except \"where a glaring omission or patent mistake or\nlike grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility\".\n16. The Division Bench after considering all the earlier precedents on the subject, summarised the same as\nfollows:\n\"(1) A review proceeding cannot be equated with the original hearing of the case, and the finality of the\njudgment delivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except \"where a glaring omission or\npatent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility\".\n(2) When a new or important matter or evidence is discovered which was not within the knowledge ofthe person seeking review at the time of hearing the case earlier or which could  not be produced by\nhim when the order was made.\n(3) The normal principle is that a judgment pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from the\nprinciple is justified only when circumstances, of a substantial and compelling character , make it\nnecessary to do so.\n(4) Review is not a rehearing of an origina l matter . The power of review cannot be confused with the\nappellate power which enables the appellate Court to correct all errors committed by a subordinate\nCourt.\n(5) A review petition has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be \"an appeal in disguise\".\n(6) An error which is not self-evident, and has to be detected by a process of reaso ning, can hardly be\nsaid to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying exercise of the power of review .\n(7) There is a clear distinction between an \"erroneous decision\" and \"an error apparent on the face of\nthe record\". While the first can be corrected by the higher forum, the latter only can be corrected by\nexercise of the review jurisdiction. So, the earlier order cannot be reviewed unless the Court is\nsatisfied that material error , manifest on the face of the order , undermines its soundness or results in\nmiscarriage of justice.\n(8) If the judgment is vitiated by an error apparent on the face of the record, in the sense that it is\nevident on a mere  look at the record without a long-drawn process of reasoning, a review\napplication is maintainable. If there is a serious irregularity in the proceeding, such as violation of\nthe principles of natural justice, a review application can be entertained.\"\n17. From the judgmen ts referred to above , it is clear that the scope of reviewing an order is very limited.\nKnowing the limitations of the High Court in an application filed under Order XLVII rules 1 and 2 of Code of\nCivil Procedure, 1908, we shall now proceed to deal with the case on hand.\n18. As seen from the record, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner , in this Review  Application, mainly found\nfault with the autho rities in imposing 100% penalty  by invoki ng section  74 of the G.S.T . Act. According to\nhim, section 74 can be invoked only while imposing penalty  of equal amount of tax in case of fraud or willful\nintention to defraud the revenue. Referring to section 10, which deals with composition of tax, he submits\nthat, sectio ns 73 and 74 of G.S.T . Act mutatis and mutandis would apply to section 10. When once sections 73\nand 74 are made applicable even in case of Composite Tax Scheme, imposing 100% penalty  in the absence of\nany fraud is illegal. In other words, his argument appears to be that imposing of penalty  under section 74 is\nnot automatic and the burden is on the authority to prove there was willful intention to defraud the revenue.\n19. The same was seriously opposed by the learned Government Pleader mainly  on the ground that, in a\nreview , even if the order is erroneous, the Court cannot review the same unless an error is apparent on record,\nwhich is not so in the instant case. Even  otherwise, he submits that the Bench which heard the Writ Petition\ndealt with these aspects and came to a conclusion and if the Petitioner is aggrieved by the same, remedy lies\nelsewhere but not by way of a Review .\n20. In order to appreciate the same, it would be used to refer to arguments advanced in the Writ Petition,\nwhich are referred to in paragraph no. 2 of the Order , as under:\n\"According to him, the respondents having accepted the option exercised by the petitioner in the web\nportal and having permitted him to pay tax at 1% of the total turnover in terms of the composite scheme,\ncannot now turn around and reject the option exercised and consequently direct the petitioner to pay GST\nas per the regular rates. He would further plead that a reading of section 10(1) of the Act, does not\nanywhere prescribe inclusion of VAT regime for the purpose of deciding the tax to be paid under section\n10(1) of GST Act. In other words, his plea is that the provisions of GST Act are not retrospective in\noperation and that the word \"preceding financial year\" has no relevance for the taxes paid for the\nfinancial year 2017-2018. He further pleads that even if the turn over from 1-7-2017 is taken into\nconsideration, the petitioner's turn over would be below Rs. 1 crore and hence the word 'preceding\nfinancial year' appearing in section 10(1) would be from financial year, after the GST regime came into\nforce and not otherwise. He took us through the provisions of GST Act in support of his plea.\"21. Dealing with the arguments advanced, the Bench of this Court after referrin g to the Judgment on the\nsubject dealt with the contentions raised in paragraphs Nos. 7, 8, 9, 9, and 10 to 12 of the Judgment and\nultimately negated the plea of the Petitio ner holding that the collection of tax under GST Act, 2017, is not in\naddition to the provisions of the VAT but this being introduced as a substitute to VAT Act to deal with both\ngoods and services, so as to maintain uniformity across the length and breadth of the country and, accordingly ,\nconfirmed the order of the 2nd Respondent.\n22. It would be appropriate to extract paragraph No. 7, where an issue was framed.\nIt is now to be seen whether the authorities were right in directing the petitione r to pay tax at 28% (14%\nS.GST and 14 % C.GST) and also as to what the word \"preceding financial year\" appearing in section\n10(1) of Act would mean?\n23. Paragraph Nos. 9, 10, 12, 14 and 15 reads as under:\n\"9. A reading of section 10(1) of A.P. GST Act, 2017 would indicate that notwithstanding anything\ncontrary to the provisions of the Act, but, subject to sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 9, a registered\nperson, whose aggregate turnover in the \"preceding financial year\" does not exceed fifty lakh rupees may\nopt to pay tax as prescribed, but not exceeding 1% of the turnover in State in case of manufacturer; 2 \u00bd\n% of the turnover in State in case of persons engaged in making supplies referred to in clause (b) of\nparagraph 6 of Schedule II; and \u00bd % of the turnover in State in case of other suppliers.\n10. Sub-se ction (3) of section 10 postulates that the option availed of by a registered person under sub-\nsection (1) shall lapse with effect from the day on which his aggregate turnover during a financial year\nexceeds the limit specified under sub-section (1).\n12. It may be true that the petitioner had paid GST under a composite scheme as per the option exercised\nin the web portal, for nearly four quarters, but, the option exercised by the petitioner was self-declaratory ,\nwhich requires verification. Therefore,  the argument of the learned Government Pleader that it took\nsometime for the authorities to examine the options exercised by all the taxpayers in the State cannot be\nbrushed aside. Merely because the petitioner has exercised an option (which should be a correct one) and\nthat it took time for the authorities to verify the genuinity or otherwise of the option exercised, cannot\nstop the respondents  from directing the petitioner to pay tax as regulated under the provisions of the GST\nAct, if the option exercised was found to be incorrect.\n14. Theref ore, the argument that the turnover in the financial year starting from  1-7-2017 has only to be\ntaken into consideration ignoring the previous turn over in the VAT regime does not sound to reason,\nbecause when the legislature at more than one place used the word 'preceding financial year', it would\nonly mean that as on 1-7-2017, the turnover of the previous year under the VAT regime has to be\nreckoned with for the purpose of extending benefit under GST regime, provi ded the self-declarations\nmade are correct. It is also to be noted that if during the course of business  in subsequent year, the\nturnover comes down, such a declaration can be made seeking reduction of tax liability . But, the turnover\nof the previous year declared under a different tax collection process cannot be eschewed for fixing the\nliability under a new tax collection process. As stated earlier , by switching over from VAT to GST\nsystem, tax payment/collection on intra state supply of goods is being continued, but, however , in a\ndifferent mode, thereby avoiding inconvenience and hardship to one and all.\n15. In the instant case, the dispute in so far as interpretation of the word 'prev ious financial year' arose\nonly for the financial year 2017-2018, as the GST regime commenced from 1-7-2017. If the intention of\nthe legisla ture was that the turnover of the financial year under GST regime is only to be taken into\nconsideration, then there would have been a clarification of the word 'preceding financial year'. Section\n10(1) of the Act would not carry any meaning if such an interpretation, as sought by the petitioner , is\ngiven, namely , the turnover in the VAT regime has to be excluded while comp uting the tax liability . If\nsuch a narrow interpretation to section  10(1) is given, as observed earlier , many of the businessmen\nwould not only escape payment of GST for the year 2017-2018, though the self-declaration made is\nincorrect or false, but also end up paying minimum GST though their turn over is on a higher side. It is to\nbe noted here that word 'preceding financial year' is appearing at more than one place in section 10 itself,\nhence, it cannot be said that there was any error in usage of the word \"preceding\" in section 10. The\nlegislature was conscious enough, when  the word 'preceding' was used before the word 'financial year' in\nsection 10(1) and also in the second proviso to section 10(1)( c), while extending benefits under a schem e.\nThe legisla ture in its wisdom observed that such a benefit can be extended to those whose turn over in theSBprevious financial year does not exceed  Rs. 50 lakhs. Therefore, the word 'preceding' appearing before\nthe word 'financial year' cannot be ignor ed and if done, one would doing mocke ry of the words 'financial\nyear does not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs'. Therefore, to fix a parameter for extending the benefits under the\nscheme and for payment of less tax in case of manufacturers and for those engaged in making supplies,\nthe legisla ture thought it fit to take into account the turnover of the previous financial year. In so far as\nthe financial year 2017-2018 under GST regime is concerned, the preceding  financial year would be\n2016-2017 under the VAT regime. The collection of tax under the GST Act, 2017 is not in addition to the\nprovisions of VAT, but, this is being introduced as a substitute to VAT Act to deal with both goods and\nservices, so as to maintain uniformity across the length and breadth of the country . This has been\nintroduced to meet the requirements under the recommendations of the GST council, in which all the\nStates and Union territories are the stakeholders.\"\n24. From the above, it is clear that the argument that was advanced at the time of hearing of the Writ Petition\nwas with regard to inclusion of VAT regime for the purpose of deciding the tax to be paid under section 10(1)\nof GST Act. In the Review Petition, it is now urged that section 10 encompasses  sections 73 and 74 of GST as\nwell and in the absen ce of any fraud, the authorities erred in invoking section 74 of the GST Act and imposing\n100% penalty .\n25. The averm ents in the affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition does not anywhere refer to the plea now\ntaken, though such plea was available at the time of filing of the Writ Petition, more so, when it involves only\ninterpretation of the provisions of GST. Without taking such plea, namely , that 100% penalty  can be imposed\nonly when there is fraud or willful conc ealment, in the Review Application such a plea is sought to be raised.\nIt is not as if that such a plea was not available at the time filing of the Writ Petition. Even otherwise, in\nparagraph no. 12 of the judgment, the Court held that the option exercised by the Petitioner was self-\ndeclaratory , which requires sometime for the authorities to verify and ultimately found it to be incorrect. The\norder under review would clearly indicate that intentional and willful non-disclosure of crucial facts can be\ninferred from the self-declaration made in the web-portal. Viewed from any angle, we do not find any grounds\nto interfere with the order impugned in the review .\n26. Accordingly , the Review application is dismissed. No order as to costs.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The Cour t while directing issue of notic e to the Respondents herein to show cause why this petition should\nnot be complied with, made the followin g order . (The receipt of this order will be deemed to be the receipt of\nnotice in the case),\nORDER:\n\"We have heard the submissions of learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner and of learned\nAssistant Solicitor General appearing for respondent nos.1 and 2. W e have perused the material record.\nThe facts, which are discernible from the pleadings and the submissions and which are relevant for\nconsideration at this stage of passing of an interim order , may be stated, in brief, as follows:\n \"For the months of July, 2017 to March, 2018 i.e., for the financial year 2017-18, the petitioner\nsubmitted GSTR-3B returns through GST portal as required under law reporting the transactions of\noutward taxable supplies and inward taxable supplies reporting the ultimate tax liability arising as a\ndifference between output tax liability and input tax liability under all the three respective\nenactments viz., IGST , CGST and SGST in terms of the annexed statements showing the input tax\ncredit which the petitioner is entitled to every month. However , according to the petitioner , while\nclaiming IGST input, the petitioner has inadvertently and by mistake reported IGST input tax credit\nin a column relating to import of goods and services instead of placing that particular amount viz.,\nIGST input tax credit in all other ITC column. Therefore, the petitioner , inter alia, contending that\nin the absence of any provision in Sectio n 39 of GST Act, 2017 or the relevant rules, the petitioner\nis entitled to rectify the mistake that has crept in GSTR-3B returns.\"\nHowever , learned Assistant Solicitor General appearing for respondent Nos. 1 and 2, having invited our\nattention to the relief claimed in the writ petition and also to Section 39(9) of the GST Act, contended\nthat the said provis ion covers the prese nt contingency because even according to the petitioner's own\nshowing, there is a mention of incorrect particulars and hence, the petitioner has an opportunity under the\nproviso to the said provision to rectify the omission but the petitioner did not avail the chance to rectify\nor modify the return s and hence, the petitioner is not entitled to the relief claim ed in the writ petition or\nan interim order .\nLearned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner has invited the attention of this Court to the decision\nof Gujarat High Court in AAP and Co., Chartered Accounts through Authorised Partner  v. Union of\nIndia  [C/SCA/18962/2018] on 24.06.2019, wherein the question considered by the learned Division\nBench of that High Court is as follows:\n 'Whether the return in Form GSTR-3B is a return required to be filed under Section 39 of the CGST\nAct/GGST Act. The aforesaid press release is valid and in consonance with Section 16(4) of the\nCGST Act/GGST Act only if Form GSTR-3B is a return required to be filed under Section 39 of\nthe CGST Act/GGST Act.'\nIn para 31 of the said judgment, the learned Division Bench observed as follows:\n '31. It would also be apposite to point out that the Notification No.10/2017 Central Tax dated 28th\nJune, 2017 which introduced mandatory filing of the return in Form GSTR-3B stated that it is aSHRUTIreturn in lieu of Form GSTR-3. However , the Government, on realizing its mistake that the return\nin Form GSTR-3B  is not intended to be in lieu of Form GSTR-3, rectified its mistake\nretrospectively vide Notification No.17/2017 Central Tax dated 27th July, 2017 and omitted the\nreference to return in Form GSTR-3B being return in lieu of Form GSTR-3.'\nFinally , Gujarat High Court held in para 32 of the said judgment as follows:\n '32. Thus, in view of the above, the impugned press release dated 18th October , 2018 could be said\nto be illegal to the extent that its para-3 purports to clarify that the last date for availing input tax\ncredit relating to the invoices issued during the period from July, 2017 to March, 2018 is the last\ndate for the filing of return in Form GSTR-3B.'\nReliance is also placed on a decision in W.P.(C)No. 35368 of 2018 of the High Court of Kerala at\nErnakulam reported on 12.11.2018, wherein the said High Court permitted the request of transfer of tax\nliability from the head 'SGST' to 'IGST' notwithstanding the contention of the revenue, as it would be\ninequitable for the petitioners therein to suffer on the count that the transfer would take sometime.\nLearned senior counsel would further contend that the provision in Section 39(9) of CGST Act referred\nto supra  would cover other contingencies like under declaration of tax etc., but does not cover\nrectification of clerical errors and in the case on hand, there is also no revenue implication.\nHaving regard to the facts and submissi ons, we are satisfied that a prima facie case is made out and that\nas the issues raised in the writ petition require detailed examination, this is a fit case to grant the interim\norder .\nAccordingly , the petitioner is permitted  to rectify GSTR-3B statements for the months of August and\nDecember , 2017 and January and February , 2018 manually subject to the outcome of the writ petition. It\nis made clear that if the petitioner submits a rectified statements for the above purpose, the respondents\nshall process the same in accordance with the procedure established by law .\"\n*In favour of assessee."}

Praveen Kumar , J. - The present Writ Petition came to be filed, seeking issuance of Writ of Mandamus,\ndeclaring the action of the respondent no. 1 in passing the \"Order of Confiscation of Goods and Conveyance\nand Dema nd of Tax, Fine and Penalty\"  vide proceedings, dated 22-9-2021, under section 130 of the State\nGoods and Service Tax Act, 2017 [for short, \"SGST Act, 2017\"], as violative of sub-sections (3) and (6) of\nsection 129 and of sub-section (4) of section 130 and the Rules made thereunder .\n2. The facts, which led to filing of the present W rit Petition, are as under:-\n(a) The petitioner herein is doing business in purchase and sale of all kinds of scrap such as Battery ,\nAlluminium Scrap, Brass Scrap and Copper Scrap. It is said that the petitioner used to purchase\nscrap from petty shops and small traders in loose quantity , put it together until it weighs 10 or 11\ntonnes and then sell the same to dealers in Kurnool and Anantapur Towns. The petitioner's annual\nturnover is around 20 to 30 Lakhs. It is said that at the time of rollout of the GST regime, the\npetitioner was instructed by the GST Officers that no registration is required for business entities\nhaving an annual sale turnover of 40 Lakhs. Hence, the petitioner is doing business without\nobtaining any registration.\n(b) While things stood  thus, on 10-9-2021, the petitioner who procured scrap from various petty\ndealers, loaded the same in a vehicle bearing No. AP 02 TC 7299 and was proceeding towards a\nweigh bridge for weighment of the goods. When the said vehicle along with the scrap was on its\nway to the weigh bridge, the respondent no. 1 herein is said to have stopped the vehicle and issued\norders, for physical verification, in Form GST MOV -02, dated 10-9-2021. The said form came to be\nissued mainly on the ground that the petitioner transported the goods without any way bills. On\nphysical verification, it was found that the petitioner was carrying 11,989 Kgs of scrap material.\nAfter issua nce of physical verification report, the respondent no. 1 issued \"Order of Detention\" of\nthe vehicle and thereafter on the very next day, the respondent no. 1 issued notice, for confiscation\nof the goods and accordingly proposals were sent, for levying penalty and fine.\n(c) The petitioner claims to have submitted his letter setting out reasons as to how the authorities erred\nin levying the tax. However , the order impugned came to be passed on 22-9-2021, ordering\nconfiscation of the goods and conveyance. Exercising the power under section  130 of SGST Act,\n2017, the material along with vehicle came to be confiscated. It was further informed to the\npetitioner that all goods should be released on payment of tax, penalty and fine within 45 days from\nthe date of said order .\n3. Assa iling the same,  the present Writ Petition came to be filed, mainly contending that the order impugned,\ncame to be passed without giving an opportunity of hearing the petitioner .\n4. A counter came to be filed by the respondents disputing the averments made in the affidavit, filed in\nsupport of the Writ Petition. It is said that the driver of the vehicle did not carry  any documents and as per the\nprovisions enshrined  in section 68 r/w. Rule 138A of SGST Act and the Rules  therein, a copy of e-way bill\nshould accompany the goods.\n(a) It is further stated that the goods vehicle was intercepted on the highway at Tapovanam, and the\nplea taken by the petitioner that it was being intercepted while it was going towards weigh bridge,\nis incorrect. It is further stated in the counter that the provisions of rule 138(1) of SGST Rules, 2017\nonly speaks about the obligation veste d upon the registered person to generate e-way bill who\ncauses the movement of goods consignment value exceeding Rs. 50,000/- and that it does not\nprohibit carrying e-way bill by the unregistered person.\n(b) It is furthe r stated that the case on hand is one of confiscation of goods under Section 130 of SGST\nAct, 2017 and not a case of levy of tax on assessment and thus the value of the goods is not the\ncriteria in adoption of the action of confiscation. Reiterating the averments in the counter filed,\nlearned Governmen t Pleader for Com mercial Taxes-II, would submit that the action of the\nauthorities can not be found fault with.5. As seen from the record, the main argument of learned counsel for the petitione r is that the authorities have\nnot follow ed the procedure required under law while passing the order of confiscation of goods and\nconveyance, more particularly , section 129 of the SGST Act, 2017. According to him, even assuming for the\nsake of argument that the petitioner has transported the goods without having valid documents, the procedure\nunder section 129(3 ) of the SGST Act, 2017 is required to be followed, meaning thereby that the Officer\ndetaining or seizing goods or conveyance shall issue a notice specifying the tax and penalty payable and\nthereafter , pass an order for payment of tax and penalty under clause (a) or clause  (b) or clause  (c). According\nto him, sub-section (5) of section 129 of SGST Act, 2017 postulates that on payment of the tax referred to in\nSub-Section (1), all proceedings in respect of the notice specified in Sub-Section (3) shall be deemed to be\nconcluded. Hence, it is said that the respondent no. 1 herein issued the order of detention on 13-9-2021,\nwithout issuing any notice under section 129(3); without giving any opportunity of hearing as required under\nsection 129(4) and without waiting for 14 days under sub-section (3) and (6) of section 129 of SGST Act,\n2017.\n6. The principal argument advanced by Sri G.Narendra Chetty , learned counsel for the petitioner is that order\ncame to be passed without giving an opportunity of hearing as required under section 130(4) of the Act. He\nfurther submits that the provisions of sections 129 and 130 of the Act are interdependent and without\nfollowing the procedure under section 128 of the Act, the order of confiscation under section 132 of the Act\ncannot be invoked. Insofar as sections 129 and 130 of the Act namely as to whether it is mandatory to follow\nsection 129 before passing an order of confiscation under section 130 of the Act.\n7. While dealing with sections 129 and 130 of the Act, a Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in Syner gy\nFertichem (P .) Ltd.  v. State of Gujarat [2019] 1 12 taxmann.com 370/[2020] 33 G.S.T .L. 513 , held as under:\n'182. W e would sum up our conclusion of the points raised in the writ applications as follows;\n\"(i) Section 129 of the Act talks about detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyances in transit.\nOn the other hand, Section 130 talks about confiscation of goods or conveyanc e and levy of tax, penalty\nand fine thereof. Although, both the sections start with a non-obstante  clause, yet, the harmonious\nreading of the two sections, keeping in mind the object and purpose behind the enactment thereof, would\nindicate that they are independent of each other . Section 130 of the Act, which provides for confiscation\nof the goods or conveyance is not, in any manner , dependent or subject to section 129 of the Act. Both\nthe sections are mutually exclusive. .\n(ii) The phrase \"with  an intent to evade the payment of tax\" in section 130 of the Act assumes\nimportance. When the law requires an intention to evade payment of tax, then it is not mere failure to pay\ntax. It must be something more. The word \"evade\" in the context means defeating the provisions of law\nof paying tax. It is made more stringent by use of the word \"intent\". The assesse e must deliberately avoid\nthe payme nt of tax which is payable in accordance with law. However , the element of mens r ea cannot be\nread into section 130 of the Act.\n(iii) For the purpose of issuing a notice of confiscation under Section 130 of the Act at the threshold, i.e.,\nat the stage of deten tion and seizure of the goods and conveyance, the case has to be of such a nature that\non the face of the entire transaction, the authority concerned should be convinc ed that the contravention\nwas with a definite intent to evade payment of tax. The action, in such circumstances, should be in good\nfaith and not be a mere pretence. In other words, the authorities need to make out a very strong case.\nMere suspicion may not be suf ficient to invoke section 130 of the Act straightway .\n(iv) If the authorities are of the view that the case is one of invoking Section 130 of the Act at the very\nthreshold, then they need to record their reasons for such belief in writing, and such reasons recorded in\nwriting should, thereafter , be looked into by the superior authority so that the superior authority can take\nan appropriate decision whether the case is one of straightway invoking section 130 of the Act.\n(v) Even if the goods or the conveyance is released upon payment of the tax and penalty under section\n129 of the Act, later, if the authorities find something incriminating against the owner of the goods in the\ncourse of the inquiry , if any, then it would be permissible to them to initiate the confiscation proceedings\nunder Section 130 of the Act.\n(vi) Section 130 of the Act is not dependent on clause (6) of Section 129 of the Act.\n(vii) Sections 129 and 130 respectively of the Act are mutually exclusive and independent of each other .\nIf the amount of tax and penalty , as determined under section 129 of the Act for the purpose of release ofthe goods and the conveyance, is not deposited within the statutory time period, then the consequence of\nthe same would be forfeiture of the goods and the vehicle with the Government. This does not necessarily\nimply that the confiscation proceedings can be initiated only in the event of the failure on the part of the\nowner of the goods or the conveyance in depositing the amount towards the tax and liability determined\nunder section 129 of the Act.\n(viii) For the purpose of section 129(6) of the Act, it would not be necessary for the department to\nestablish any intenti on to evade payment of tax. If the tax and penalty , as determined under Section 129,\nis not deposited within the statutory time period, then the goods and the convey ance shall be liable to be\nput to auction and the sale proceeds shall be deposited with the Government.\n(ix) Similarly , the refer ence to Sections 73 and 74 respectively of the Act is not warranted for the purpose\nof interpreting Sections 129 and 130 of the Act, more particularly , when they all are independent of each\nother . The provisions of sections 73 and 74 of the Act are similar to the provisi ons of section 11A of the\nCentral Excise Act and section 28 of the Customs Act, which deal with the adjudication proceedings.\nDespite this, section 110 is present in the Customs Act, which speaks about seizure and similarly , section\n129 is present in the Act for detention/seizure. Therefore, Sections 129 and 130 of the Act have  non-\nobstante  clauses, whereby they can be operated upon in spite of sections 73 and 74 of the Act.\n(x) The provisions of sections 73 and 74 respectively of the Act deal with the 'demands and recovery' to\nbe made by the assessing officer based upon the assessment, whereas the provisions of Section 129 of the\nAct deal with the 'detention/ seizure'. While assessing the returns, if the assessing officer finds that the\namount of tax has not been paid or erroneously refunded, or where the input tax credit has been wrongly\navailed or utilized for any reason, either  with mala fide  intention or without  the same, as the case may be,\nthe provisions of section 73/74 of the Act would be invoked. However , the provisions of section 129 of\nthe Act deal with situation where the evasion of tax/contravention of the Act/Rules is detected during\ntransit itself, requiring the adoption of summary like proceedings. Therefore, the said provisions operate\nin dif ferent spheres.\n(xi) The comparison of the provisions of Customs Act/ Excise Act on one hand and the provisions of the\nAct on the other , as sought to be drawn on behalf of the writ applicants, is not correct. Section 110(1) of\nthe Custom s Act is not comparable to section 129(1) of the Act inasmuch as, the provisions of Section\n110 of the Customs Act contemplates that the proper officer may seize the goods which are liable for\nconfiscation, wherea s the provisions of section 129 contemplate that the proper officer may detain/ seize\nthe goods/ conveyance in transit in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the Rules.\n(xii) The provisions of sections 110(2) and 124 of the Customs Act do not contemplate that the goods\nwhich are seized are to be released in a specific time limit, much less, within  a period of six months.\nApropos this, the said sections merely cast a duty on the department to issue a show cause notice within a\nperiod of six month s from the date of seizure of goods, but the same does not contemplate as to in how\nmuch time, the same has to be adjudica ted upon. Therefore, the contention raised on behalf of the writ\napplicants that the goods which are seized are to be released within a short span of time and that the\nlegislature has not contemplated to retain the goods pending the confiscation proceedings. is not tenable.\nIn addition to the above, even otherwise, the provisions of section 110A of the Customs Act, which deal\nwith the 'provisional release' of the goods, do not contemplate the release of the goods only on payment\nof penalty and interest but the proposed amount of fine is also to be included for provisional release of\nthe goods.  In view of this, the amount of fine should be taken into account while  directing the provisional\nrelease of the goods/ conveyance as per section 129(2) read with section 67(6) of the Act read with Rule\n140 of the Rules.\n(xiii) Although there is no serious challenge to the validity of the provisions of sections 129 and 130\nrespectively of the Act, yet it is a settled principle of law that the power to levy tax includes all the\nincidental powers to prevent the evasion  of such tax. The power to seize and confiscate the goods in the\nevent of evasion of tax and the power to levy penalty are meant to check tax evasion and is intended to\noperate as a deterrent against the tax-evaders and are, therefore, ancillary or incidental to the power to\nlevy tax on the goods and thus, fall within the ambit and scope of the legislative powers.\"\n8. From the judgment of the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court, it is clear that sections 129 and 130 of\nthe Act are independent feature and the Act does not contemplate invoking section 129 before passing an\norder of confiscation under section 130 of the Act. The view taken by the Gujar at High Court was also upheldANURAGby the Division Bench of this Court in Sangeetha Jewellers  v. Dy. Asstt. Commissioner [2021] 124\ntaxmann.com 102 . Hence, we are in agreement with the view expressed by the Division Bench on this aspect.\n9. Coming to the second ground raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner namely that an opportunity of\npersonal hearing is not given, it has to be noted that pursuant to the notice given, the petitioner herein\nsubmitted written objections, which are referred to in the order . The order also states that the owner of the\ngoods, in his reply stated that no personal hearing is required, as he has subm itted his reply . Of course, this\naspect is disputed by the learned counsel for the petitioner , but from the record , a detailed written reply was\ngiven explaining his stand, which was not accepted. If factual aspects or perusal of record is warranted, the\npetitioner ought to have preferred an appeal, as provided under the Act. The scope of interference under\nArticle 226 is very limited, hence the order passed by the authority warrants no interference.\n10. At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner mainly submits that he may be directed to pay tax and\npenalty as ordered. He also submits that the quantum of fine imposed towards confiscation of goods\napparently is on a higher side. According to him, it is almost equal to the value of the goods. He also disputes\nlevy of fine for confiscation of the conveyance as it is almost equal to the present day value of the vehicle.\n11. Sri Y.N.V ivekananda, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax appearing for the respondents,\nsubmits that since there is clear violat ion of the provisions of the Act, order  under challenge requires no\ninterference.\n12. Taking into consid eration the facts in issue and the two findings recorded by us earlier , we hereby\ndisposed of the writ petition directing the petitioner to pay tax and penalty as ordered in the impugned order .\nBut insofar as the payment of fine, we feel that the amount of Rs. 9,00,000/-as ordered appears to be on higher\nside, as such the same is reduced to Rs. 4,00,000/-. Insofar as fine relating to confiscation of conveyance is\nconcerned, having regard to the fact that it is lying with the authorities since pretty long time, we feel that an\namount of Rs. 1,40,774/- as ordered to be paid may be reduced to Rs. 1,00,000/-. No costs.\n13. All pending miscellaneous petitions if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

S A V Saikumar , AGP for the Respondent\nJUDGMENT\n \nRavi Nath  Tilhari,  J. - Heard Sri Kalepu Yashwanth, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri S A V\nSaikumar , learned AGP for Commercial T axes.\n2. The petitioner -Tikona Infinet Private Limited (TIPL) has filed this writ petition for a Writ of Mandamus\nunder article 226 of the Constitution of India, to declare the impugned show cause notice in Form GST DRC-\n01, dated 29-9-2023 bearing DIN No. ZD370923020771D issued by the 3rd respondent-the Deputy Assistant\nCommissioner , State Taxes, Dabagardens Circle, Visakhapatnam-1 Division, Andhra Pradesh, as illegal,\narbitrary and in contravention of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST)/Andhra Pradesh Goods and\nServices T ax (APGST) Act and Rules, and consequently to  set aside the same.\n3. The petiti oner has prayed for a further declaration that the Input Tax Credit (ITC) claim cannot be denied\non the basis of trans fer done manually and not by filing Form GST-ITC 02 electronically under section 18 (3)\nof CGST Act read with rule 41 of the CGST Rules, as functionality to file Form GST-ITC 02 electronically\nwas absent.\n4. The petitioner/TIPL  is a Company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and is inter alia engaged in\nproviding internet services across India from various States, including from the State of Andhra Pradesh. The\n3rd respondent-the Deputy Assistant Commissioner , State T axes issued show cause notice in From GST DRC-\n01, dated 29-9-2023 bearing DIN No.Z D370923020771D, impugned in the present petition. The said notice\nwas issued, in view of the fact that the 3rd respondent concluded that the petitioner claimed ITC for Rs.\n31,81,529/- in contravention of the provisions of section 16 of the APGST Act 2017, and therefore, it was\nproposed to levy Rs. 31,81,529/- towards excess claim of input tax more than the eligibility as per the\nprovisions of the APGST Act 2017. It was also proposed that the petitioner was liable to pay Rs. 38,46,389/-\ntowards the discrepancies identified in the said notice. The petitioner was also informed that he was liable to\npay interest under section 50 of the GST Act 2017 towards the short payment of taxes. By the impugned show\ncause notice, the petitioner has been granted opportunity to file objections, if any, along with the documentary\nevidence, within a specified time from the date of receipt of the notice, which further provides that failing\nwhich, orders deemed fit would be passed without further notice or time. The petitioner has also been\nprovided to express the desire to be represented personally on the date fixed under prior intimation.\n5. The facts  are that the petitioner/TIPL entered into a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA), dated 17-8-2017\nwith Tikona Digital Networks (TDN),  vide which the business of TDN was transferred to the petitioner , as a\ngoing concern. It is submitted that the TDN filed letter dated 13-9-2017 to the Commercial Tax Officer\nintimating that as per rule 41(1) of CGST Rules, a registered person intending to transfer the input tax credit is\nrequired to file GST-ITC 02 on the common portal to the transferee and TDN intended to transfer unutilized\ncredit in the electro nic credit ledger of TDN on the date of slump sale to TIPL, but Form ITC-02 was not\navailable on GSTN portal, and consequently , TDN was not able to transfer on GSTN portal and TIPL was\nunable to utilize the credit balance appearing in the electronic credit ledger of TDN. Consequently , it was\nrequested to let TDN know the procedure to be followed for transfer of credit from TDN to TIPL under the\ncircumstances. It is further submitted that the petitioner/TIPL also submitted letter dated 12-2-2018 to thejurisdictional author ity duly intimating about the transfer of ITC to TDN manually . A certificate dated 9-2-\n2018 by the Chartered Accountant certifying the transfer of business is also said to have been issued.\n6. The Assistant Com missioner (ST), Dabagardens, Visakhapatnam issued notice GST ASMT -10, bearing\nReference No. ZD370423019170U, dated 11-4-2023, intimating the discrepancy in the return after scrutiny\n(scrutiny notice) and calling for the explanation for such discrepancy . The petitioner submitted the\nreply/explanation dated 16/17-5-2023. On consideration of the petitioner's reply , the impugned show cause\nnotice dated 29-9-2023 has been issued, granting opportunity to file objections along with documentary\nevidence, as also providing personal hearing, if so desired.\n7. Sri S A V Saikumar , learned AGP for Commercial Taxes, raised preliminary objection that the writ petition\nchallenging the show cause notice is premature and is not entertainable. The petitioner has the opportunity to\nsubmit the explanation, to lead the evidence before the 3rd respondent, as also to avail the opportunity of\npersonal hearing and it is only after the petitioner avails such opportunity , and if then some adverse decision is\ntaken, the petitioner can challenge the same in appropriate proceedings under statutory provisions. But\nbypassing such procedure and the remedy, writ petition filed directly to challenge the show cause notice\nwould not be maintainable. He placed reliance in the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nAssistant Commissioner of State Tax v. Commer cial Steel Ltd. 2021 SCC OnLin e SC 884/[2021] 130\ntaxmann.com 180 /2021 (52) G.S.T .L. 385 /88 GST 799 (SC) .\n8. To the aforesaid submissions, Sri Kalepu Yashwanth, learned counsel for the petitioner , submitted that in\nview of the admitted position that the petitioner filed, manually and not electronically the Form GST - ITC 02,\nas provided by Section 18 (3) of the CGST Act, read with rule 41 of CGST Rules, the 3rd respondent would\nnot consider such filing and would hold that the petitioner would not be entitled for ITC claim, and\nconsequently , appro aching the 3rd respondent with the objections and the evidence would be in futility . He\nsubmitted that the petitioner had the justification for not filing Form GST-ITC 02 electronically , as the same\nwas not available on the portal and consequently , this Court may direct the 3rd respondent to take into\nconsideration the manual filing, reading down the provision for electronically filing and if the same is\nconsidered, the petitioner would be entitled for the ITC claim and in transfer thereof, there was no violation or\nillegality and consequently , there would be no liabilities, for which the impugned notice has been issued. He\nsubmitted that the petitioner , as also the petitioner's transferor , previously  vide letters, referred to above,\nintimated the said fact to the adjudicating authority .\n9. He further submitted that under the same circumstances, the same petitioner filed Writ Tax No. 859 of\n2023, Neutral Citat ion No. 2023:AHC:152051- DB. Tikona Infinet (P.) Ltd. v. State of U.P. [2023] 153\ntaxmann.com 170/99  GST 329/2023 (77) G.S.T .L. 237/[2023] 9 Centax 107 (All.) , before the Division Bench\nof the Allahabad High Court which  set aside the Order dated 17-4-2023, which was passed against the same\npetitioner , and directed the Authority to pass fresh orders taking into consideration the objections of the\npetitioner and also affording opportunity  of hearing, strictly in accordance with law, vide judgment and order\ndated 25-7-2023.\n10. Learned counsel for the petitioner furth er submitted that under the same circumstances, where Form GST-\nITC 02 for transfer of input tax credit electronically could not be done due to non availability of GST-ITC 02\non the Portal and manual filing was done, the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur in Civil Writ\nPetition No. 12190/2019, between Pacific Industries Ltd. v. Union of India [2022] 137 taxmann .com 247/91\nGST 660 /2022 (61) G.S.T .L. 592 , allowed the said petition on 15-3-2022, and directed the respondents therein\nto regularize the input tax credit in favour of the petitioner therein, as per the entitlement.\n11. Learned counsel for the petitioner also placed reliance in the case of this Court in K.V. Reddy Granites and\nExports  v. State of Andhra Pradesh, the Additional Commissioner (State Tax) 2023 (8) TMI 1212 AP\nHC/[2023] 153 taxmann.com 542/99 GST 683/2023 (77) G.S.T .L. 221/[2023] 9 Centax 291 to contend that in\nthe said case, the appeal was filed manu ally and the same was rejected on the said ground that it was not filed\nelectronically , but this Court allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of rejection, holding that even if\nthe appeal was not filed electronically , but manually , the right of appeal being a valuable right, consideration\nof the appeal could  not be denied on the principle that when substantial justice is pitted against technical\nconsiderations, it would be always necessary to prefer the ends of justice. He has further placed reliance on\nthe judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri Siddhi Kalko Bhagavan Stone Crusher  v. Asstt. Commr .\nof S.T., Vizianagaram 2019 SCC  OnLine AP 281/[2020] 115 taxmann.com 429/2020 (42) G.S.T .L. 328 to the\nsame ef fect, as the judgment in K.V. Reddy Granites and Exports  (supra ).12. The subm ission of the learned counsel for the petitioner therefore is that the writ petition deserves to be\nentertained and the prayer as made deserves to be allowed.\n13. Sri S A V Saikumar , learned AGP for Commercial Taxes submitted that the Government of India,\nMinistry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs issued Circular\nNo. 39/13/2018-GST , F.No.267/7/2018-CX.8, dated 3-4-2018, on the subject of setting up of an IT Grievance\nRedressal Mechanis m to address the grievances of taxpayers due to technical glitches on GST portal. He\nsubmits that in case of any grievance due to technical glitches, the tax payer has to follow the procedure\nprescribed therein by filing an appropri ate application before the authorities mentioned there under , but any\nsuch application or grievance was not raised, and raising grievance before the commissioner/tax officer is not\nbefore the appropria te authority to redre ss such grievance. Consequently , his submission is that as to whether\nthe electronically filing on GST -ITC 02 was available or not or there was some error , due to which it could not\nbe filed, is a question of fact, which deserves to be decided by the Authority . If the petitioner has any such\ngrievance, the same may also be raised while filing objections pursuant to the notice and the authority\ncompetent to look in that aspect shall consider the same as well.\n14. To the aforesaid submissions, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the said Circular is dated 3-\n4-2018, whereas the relevant period with respect to the petitioner's grievance pertains to the year 2017.\n15. Learned AGP for Commercial Taxes then submitted that even at that time, the grievance could be raised\nbefore the authority competent, but not before the Commissioner .\n16. We have considered the submissions advanced and perused the material on record.\n17. There is no disput e on the factual aspect that the petitioner clamed ITC, but did not file GST-ITC 02\nelectronically as per section 18 of CGST Act and rule 41 of the CGST Rules 2017.\n18. There is also no dispute on the legal position that it was required to be filed electronically in GST-ITC 02\nForm as per the aforesaid provisions.\n19. Section 18 of CGST Act 2017 reads as under:\n\"Section 18: A vailability of credit in special Circumstances:\n(1) Subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed\u2014\n(a) a person who has applied for registration under this Act within thirty days from  the date on which\nhe becomes liable to registration and has been granted such registration shall be entitled to take\ncredit of input tax in respect of inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or\nfinished goods held in stock on the day immediately preceding the date from which he becomes\nliable to pay tax under the provisions of this Act;\n(b) a person who takes registration under sub-section (3) of section 25 shall be entitled to take credit of\ninput tax in respect of inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods\nheld in stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant of registration;\n(c) where any registered  person ceases to pay tax under section 10, he shall be entitled to take credit of\ninput tax in respect of inputs held in stock, inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held\nin stock and on capital goods on the day immediately preceding the date from which he becomes\nliable to pay tax under section 9: Provid ed that the credit on capital goods shall be reduced by such\npercentage points as may be prescribed;\n(d) where an exempt supply of goods or services or both by a registered person becomes a taxable\nsupply , such person shall be entitled to take credit of input tax in respect of inputs held in stock and\ninputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock relatable to such exempt supply\nand on capital goods exclusively used for such exempt supply on the day immediately preceding\nthe date from which such supply becomes taxable: Provided that the credit on capital goods shall be\nreduced by such percentage points as may be prescribed.\n(2) A registered person shall not be entitled to take input tax credit under sub-sec tion (1) in respect of any\nsupply of goods or services or both to him after the expiry of one year from the date of issue of tax\ninvoice relating to such supply .(3) Where  there is a change in the constitution of a registered person on account of sale, merger,\ndemer ger, amalgam ation, lease or transfer of the business with the specific provisions for transfer of\nliabilities, the said registered person shall be allowed to transfer the input tax credit which remains\nunutilised in his electronic credit ledger to such sold, merged, demer ged, amalgamated, leased or\ntransferred business in such manner as may be prescribed.\n(4) Where  any registered person who has availed of input tax credit opts to pay tax under section 10 or,\nwhere the goods or services or both supplied by him become wholly exempt, he shall pay an amount, by\nway of debit in the electronic credit ledger or electronic cash ledger , equivalent  to the credit of input tax\nin respect of inputs held in stock and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock\nand on capital good s, reduced by such percentage points as may be prescribed,5 on the day immediately\npreceding the date of exercising of such option or, as the case may be, the date of such exemption:\nProvided that after payment of such amount, the balance of input tax credit, if any, lying in his electronic\ncredit ledger shall lapse.\n(5) The amount of credit under sub-section (1) and the amount payable under sub-section (4) shall be\ncalculated in such manner as may be prescribed.6\n(6) In case of supply of capital goods or plant and machinery , on which input tax credit has been taken,\nthe registe red person  shall pay an amount equal to the input tax credit taken on the said capital goods or\nplant and machinery reduced by such percentage points as may be prescribed7 or the tax on the\ntransaction value of such capital goods or plant and machinery determined unde r section 15, whichever is\nhigher:\nProvided  that where refractory bricks, moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures are supplied as scrap, the\ntaxable person may pay tax on the transaction value of such goods determined under section 15.\"\n20. Rule 41 of the CGST Rules 2017 reads as under:\n\"Rule-41 T ransfer of credit on sale, mer ger, amalgamation, lease or transfer of a business:\n(1) A registered person shall, in the event of sale, merger, de-mer ger, amalgamation, lease or transfer or\nchange in the owne rship of business for any reason, furnish the details of sale, merger, de-mer ger,\namalgamation, lease or transfer of busin ess, in FORM GST ITC-02, electronica lly on the common portal\nalong with a request for transfer of unutilized input tax credit lying in his electronic credit ledger to the\ntransferee:\nProvided  that in the case of demer ger, the input tax credit shall be apportioned in the ratio of the value of\nassets of the new units as specified in the demer ger scheme.\n1 Explanation : - For the purpose of this sub-rule, it is hereby clarified that the \"value of assets\" means the\nvalue of the entire assets of the business, whether or not input tax credit has been availed thereon.\".\n(2) The transfer or shall also submit a copy of a certificate issued by a practicing chartered accountant or\ncost accountant certifying that the sale, merger, de-mer ger, amalgamation, lease or transfer of business\nhas been done with a specific provision for the transfer of liabilities.\n(3) The transferee shall, on the common portal, accept the details so furnished by the transfer or and,\nupon such acceptance, the un-utilized credit specified in FORM GST ITC- 02 shall be credited to his\nelectronic credit ledger .\n(4) The inputs and capital goods so transferred shall be duly accounted for by the transferee in his books\nof account.\"\n21. The question, if electronically filing in GST-ITC 02 could not be because of some technical error , non-\navailability on GST portal of such Form at the relevant point of time, is a question, which can be duly\nconsidered and decided if such plea is taken in the objections pursuant to the show cause notice, by the\ncompetent authority . Even if it could not be filed electronically for the reason as mentioned in the letter of the\npetitioner and also of TDN and manual filing could have been done or the petitioner could have waited for\nsome period for availability of GST-ITC 02 Form on the portal, is also a quest ion, which can be considered\nand decided by the competent authority . By the show cause notice, the petitioner has been afforded\nopportunity to file objections and also to file evidence. The petitioner by taking such objection and by filingevidence, of non-availability of Form GST-ITC 02 on the GST portal at that point of time with supporting\ndocuments, as also the evidence of manual filing and showing his entitlement for such ITC can pursue its\nclaim for ITC. If such evidence is filed and if the petitioner appears before the authority for personal hearing\nand files such evide nce, this Court do not see any reason as to why the authority will not consider the same\nand taking a reasonable view of the matter would not pass appropriate orders, in accordance with law. To\ncontend that in view of rule position, the authority would not consider the manual filing and in the absence of\nthe electronically filing, would not allow the claim, is too early and appears to us a mere apprehension,\ninasmuch as the authority which has to pass the order after affording the opportunity of hearing based on\nevidence placed and on consideration of the objections, is expected to decide the same reasonably , in fairness\nand for the reasons recorded. If still the petitioner feels aggrieved, the Statute provides for the remedy and in\nthe absence of statutory remedy or equally efficacious alternative remedy , the person aggrieved can also\napproach this Court under article 226 of the Constitution of India.\n22. We do not find any reason, at this stage of the issuance of show cause notice, particularly , when there is no\nchallenge to the jurisdiction of the authority issuing the show cause notice, as also in the absence of any\nargument challengin g the notice on such grounds, on which the judicial review may be open against the show\ncause notice, to entertain the writ petition.\n23. In Commer cial Steel Ltd. (supra ), upon which learne d AGP placed reliance, the Hon'ble Apex Court, on\nthe point of maintai nability of the writ petition under article 226 of the Const itution of India, held that the\nexistence of an alternate remedy is not an absolute bar to the maintainability of writ petition under article 226\nof the Constitution of India, but a writ petition can be maintained in exceptional circumstances where there is;\n(i) a breach of funda mental rights; (ii) a violation of the principles of natural justice; (iii) an excess of\njurisdiction; or ( iv) a challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated legislation. However , finding that in the\nsaid case none of the exceptions was established, it was held that it was not appropriate for the High Court to\nentertain the writ petition.\n24. It is apt refer paragraphs 1 1 and 12 of the judgment in Commer cial Steel Ltd.  (supra ) as under:\n\"11. The respondent had a statutory remedy under section 107. Instead of availing of the remedy , the\nrespondent instituted a petition under article 226. The existence of an alternate remedy is not an absolute\nbar to the maintainability of a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution. But a writ petition can\nbe entertained in exceptional circumstances where there is:\n(i) a breach of fundamental rights;\n(ii) a violation of the principles of natural justice;\n(iii) an excess of jurisdiction; or\n(iv) a challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated legislation.\n12. In the present case, none of the above exceptions was established. There was, in fact, no violation of\nthe principles of natural justice since a notice was served on the person in charge of the conveyance. In\nthis backdrop, it was not appropriate for the High Court to entertain a writ petition. The assessment of\nfacts would have to be carried out by the appellate authority . As a matter of fact, the High Court has\nwhile doing this exercise proceeded on the basis of surmises. However , since we are inclined to relegate\nthe respondent to the pursuit of the alternate statutory remedy under section 107, this Court makes no\nobservation on the merits of the case of the respondent.\"\n25. The submission of the learned AGP based on the aforesaid judgment is that the petitioner's case is not\ncovered under any of the exceptions to maintain the writ petition. There is no dispute on such position of law\nregarding maintainability of writ petition. Any argument, except the mentioned above, has not been advanced\nby the learned counsel for the petitioner so as to attract the exceptions.\n26. In Special Director  v. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse (2004) 3 SCC 440/[2004] 50 SCL 93 the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt deprecated the practice of High Courts entertaining writ petitions question ing the legality of show cause\nnotices stalling enqu iries as proposed and retarding investigative process. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that\nunless the High Court is satisfied that the show cause notice was totally  non est in the eye of the law for\nabsolute want of jurisdiction of the authority to even investigate into facts, the writ petitions should not be\nentertained for the mere asking and as a matter of routine, and the writ petitioner should invariably be directed\nto respond to the show cause notice and take all stands highlighted in the writ petition.27. It is apt to refer paragraph-5 of Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse  (supra ) as under:\n\"5. This Court in a large number of cases has deprecated the practice of the High Courts entertaining writ\npetitions questioning legality of the show-cause notices stalling enquiries as proposed and retarding\ninvestigative process to find actual facts with the participation and in the presence of the parties. Unless\nthe High Court is satisfied that the show-cause notice was totally  non est in the eye of the law for\nabsolute want of jurisdiction of the authority to even investigate into facts, writ petitions should not be\nentertained for the mere asking and as a matter of routine, and the writ petitio ner should invariably be\ndirected to respond to the show-cause notice and take all stands highlighted in the writ petition. Whether\nthe show-cause notice was founded on any legal premises, is a jurisdictional issue which can even be\nurged by the recipie nt of the notice and such issues also can be adjudicated by the authority issuing the\nvery notice initially , before the aggriev ed could approach the court. Further , when the court passes an\ninterim order it should be careful to see that the statutory functionaries specially and specifically\nconstituted for the purpose are not denuded of powers and authority to initially decide the matter and\nensure that ultimate relief which may or may not be finally granted in the writ petition is not accorded to\nthe writ petitioner even at the threshold by the interim protection granted.\"\n28. In C.C.E.  v. Krishna Wax (P.) Ltd. (2020) 12 SCC 572/[2020] 113 taxmann.com 70/77 GST 562 (SC) the\nHon'ble Apex Court reiterated that it is well settled that writ petition should normally not be entertained\nagainst mere issuance of show cause notice. The said matter pertained to the Central Excise Act. It was held\nthat excise law is a complete code in itself and it would normally not be appropriate to writ court to entertain\nwrit petitio n under article 226 of the Constitution of India and that the person concerned must first raise all the\nobjections before the authority who had issued the show cause notice and the redressal in terms of the existing\nprovisions of the law could be taken resort to if an adverse order is passed against such person.\n29. It is apt to refer paragraphs-14 and 15 of Krishna W ax (P .) Ltd.  (supra ) as under:\n\"14. It has been laid down by this Court that the excise law is a complete code in itself and it would\nnormally not be appropriate for a writ court to entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution\nand that the person concerned must first raise all the objections before the authority who had issued a\nshow-cause notice and the redressal in terms of the existing provisions of the law could be taken resort to\nif an adve rse order was passed against such person. For example in Union of India  v. Guwahati Carbon\nLtd. [Union of India  v. Guwahati Carbon Ltd., (2012) 11 SCC 651], it was concluded; \"The Excise Law\nis a comp lete code in order to seek redress in excise matters and hence may not be appropriate for the\nwrit court to entert ain a petition unde r Article 226 of the Constitution\", while in Malladi Drugs &\nPharma Ltd.  v. Union of India  [Malladi Drugs & Pharma Ltd. v. Union of India , (2020) 12 SCC 808] , it\nwas observed:\n\"\u2026 The High Cour t, has, by the impugned judgment held that the appellant should first raise all the\nobjections before the Authority who have issued the show-cause notice and in case any adverse order is\npassed against the appellant, then liberty has been granted to approach the High Court \u2026\n\u2026 in our view , the High Court was absolutely right in dismissing the writ petition against a mere show-\ncause notice.\"\n15. It is thus well settled that writ petition should normally not be entertained against mere issuance of\nshow-cause notice. In the present case no show-cause notice was even issued when the High Court had\ninitially entertained the petition and directed the Department to prima facie consider whether there was\nmaterial to proceed with the matter .\"\n30. In the present case, APGST Act is also a complete code and consequently , we are of the considered view\nthat the petitioner should respond to the show cause notice raising all such objections, as may be raised before\nthe author ity issuing the show cause notice and in case any adverse order is passed and the petitioner feels\naggrieved, the petitioner may then have recourse to the appropriate proceedings.\n31. Any provision that if under the circumstances as stated by the learned coun sel for the petitioner and\nmentioned in the letter of the petitioner filed before the assessing authority , if electronically filing was not\npossible, and consequently , the manual filing was done, the manual filing would not be taken into\nconsideration, has not been brought to our notice.\n32. In Tikona Infinet (P.) Ltd. (supra ), the Allahabad High Court, no doubt  set aside the order passed therein\nbut with direction to the respondents therein to pass fresh orders taking into consideration the objections of thepetitioner therein, and from reading of the said judgment, what transpires to us, is that the said order was\npassed as the Allahabad High Court found that the objections filed by the petitioner therein were not\nconsidered by the 2nd respondent therein and the order was passed on technicalities by the said respondent.\nThus, in the said case, the objection was filed before the authority and the same was rejected on technicalities\nand challenging the order passed, Writ Tax was filed. In the present case, there is no final order by the\nauthority rejecting the objections of the petitioner on technicalities. At this stage, it is only the apprehension of\nthe petitioner that it may be rejected on technicalities. On a mere apprehensi on of such a nature, the writ\npetition is not to be entertained.\n33. A perusal of the order of the Allahabad High Court further shows as under:\n\"Be that as it may, we find that the petitioner has been non suited on the ground that Form ITC 02 for\ntransfer of input tax credit was not available on the GST Portal which was in nascent stage during the\ninitial months after its implementation on 1-7-2017 and it was incumbent upon the petitioner to have\nraised a proper grievance on the GST portal help-desk and ought to have waited for the relevant Form to\ngo live on the GST  portal instead of making illegal adjustment by use of the Form GSTR-3B of the\ntransferor and the transferee company and mere shortage of working capital cannot be an excuse to\nbypass the legal procedure laid down under the law .\nWe are of the view that the stand of the Respondent No. 2, for rejecting the claim of the petitioner in the\nwake of the admitted fact that the GST common portal was not online cannot be justified. We\nconsequently  set aside the order dated 17-4-2023 with liberty to the Respondent No. 2 to pass fresh order\ntaking into consideration the objections of the petitioner and also affording it opportunity of hearing,\nstrictly in accordance with law .\"\n34. From the aforesaid quoted paragraph, it is evident that the Allahabad High Court observed that it was\nincumbent upon the petitioner therein to raise proper objection and ought to have waited for the relevant Form\nto go live on the GST portal instead of making illegal adjustment by use of the Form GSTR-3B of the\ntransferor and the transferee company and mere shortage of working capital could not be an excuse to bypass\nthe legal procedure laid down under the law, which prima facie  supports the contention as raised by the\nlearned AGP for Commercial Taxes that in case of any grievance with respec t to filing of electronically or\nunavailability of such Form on the portal, the grievance could have been raised on GST portal help desk.\nThough, we are not observing the same as has been observed by the Allahabad High Court, but we find force\nin the submission of the learned AGP for Commercial Taxes that such grievance should have been raised on\nGST portal help desk. However , in our view , that would not determine the matter in issue conclusively . If such\ngrievance was not raised on GST portal for some reasons, but the same was raised before the authority even\nprior to the show cause notice,  vide the correspondence mentioned above, the authority who had issued the\nimpugned show cause notice should consider the said aspect of the matter as well, while considering the\npetitioner's other objections, if so raised.\n35. In Tikona Infinet (P.) Ltd. (supra ) there was admitted position with respect to the non-availability of the\nForm GST  ITC 02 in GST portal for the entire period of 30 days from the registration of the separate business\nof the entity therein and even on the date of filing of the writ petition. In the present case, such a position is\nnot admitted, which the petitioner would be required to state and establish before the authority .\n36. In Pacific Industries Ltd. (supra ) the petiti oner therein was deprived from submitting the Form GST ITC-\n02A online and as a consequence, the petitioner was deprived from availing the Input Tax Credit through\nForm GST R-3B. In the said case, such assertion in the writ petition about the non-availability of the Form\nGST ITC-02A on the GST portal was not denied. Further , consequent upon the petitioner being deprived, for\nthe said reason, in submitting Form GST ITC-02A online, the petitioner  therein was deprived as a\nconsequence thereof from availing the input tax credit.\n37. In the present case, the petitioner has not been deprived from availing the input tax credit as of now, but\nthe show cause notice has been issued  granting opportunity . So, at this stage, it cannot be said that as a\nconsequence of not submitting Form GST ITC-02 electronically , the petitioner has been deprived of the claim\nof input tax credit. The petitioner has the opportunity and on such opportunity on verification of such fact, the\nauthority has yet to consider the petitioner's claim of input tax credit.\n38. The judgments of this Court in K.V. Reddy Granites  (supra ) and Sri Siddhi Kalko Bhagavan Stone\nCrusher  (supra ) are on the point of filing of appeal under section 107 of the APGST Act 2017  and Rule 108\nof APGST Rules 2017. In those cases, the appeals were filed manually and not electronically . The appeal is aRITAvaluable right which cannot be taken away on the ground of technicalities.  So far as utilization of the\nunutilized and transfer of ITC is concern ed, the same is subject to acceptance. The same cannot be equated as\nright to appeal. The question as involved in the present case was not involved in those two cases.\n39. The submission of the petitioner's counsel to read down the provisions of rule 41 of the CGST Rules and\nto direct to accept the manual filing, at this stage, deserves rejection, as neither rule 41 of the CGST Rules is\nunder challenge nor is shown to be contrary to any provision of CGST Act, and particularly when the\npetitioner has the opportunity before the Authority pursuant to the show cause notice to justify manual filing.\n40. For all the aforesaid reasons, we are of the considered view that the petitioner should approach the\nauthority which has issued the show cause notice and file the objections with evidence, and if so desire, to\navail the opportunity  of personal hearing with due intimation to the authority concerned. At the stage of show\ncause notice, we are not inclined to entertain the challenge to the said notice, in the absence of any ground of\nwant of jurisdiction of the authority in issue of notice.\n41. Since the period granted to the petition er to file the objections and appear before the authority concerned\nhas already expired, we provide that if the petitioner files objections with evidence and shows his willingness\nfor person al hearing, within a period of one week from the date of receipt of copy of this order to the authority\nconcerned, the same shall be considered and decided, as expeditiously as possi ble, preferably within 4 (four)\nweeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order , in accordance with law .\n42. With the aforesaid observations and directions, the W rit Petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.\nPending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand closed in consequence.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The petitioner is challenging the impugned order dated 27.12.2023 passed under Section 73(9) of the\nC.G.S.T . Act 2017, along with the show cause notice dated 28.09.2023 under Section 73(1). The\nchallenge is on the ground that the period of limitation of three (03) years with ef fect from 07.02.2020 for\nthe assessment year 2017-18, i.e. the extended period vide notification dated 03.02.2020 also expired on\n07.02.2023. The impugned show cause  notice and the impugned order passed under Section 73 are\nbeyond the period of limitation which cannot be sustained being without jurisdiction. He submits that\nthough the notification dated 31.03.2023 has been issued under Section 168A of the Act, but that would\nalso not cover/save the present case, for limitation, as the notification itself is beyond the powers of\nSection 168A. The notification dated 31.03.2023 is also under challenge in the present petition. His\nsubmission is that such notification could be issued under Section 168A, only when the actions could not\nbe completed under the Act, by 'Force Majeure', but any such Force Majeure is not mentioned in the\nnotification which necessitated or empowered for its issuance.\n3. He further submi ts that the High Court of Gujarat in the case of M/s.

Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit, as against the show cause notice dated 31.12.2021, the\npetitioner submitted its reply dated 4-3-2 022 wherein the petitioner has specific ally prayed the 1st respondent\nto afford a personal hearing in view of involvement of voluminous record as well as the factual and legal\naspects to be submitted physically . However , no such opportunity was afforded to the petitioner but theimpugned order came to be passed on 25-7-2022 and thereby the petitioner was deprived of the principles of\nnatural justice. He thus prayed that the impugned order dated 25-7-2022 may be set aside and the matter may\nbe remanded back to the 1st respondent for hearing and to pass the order on merits.\n4. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax opposed the writ petition.\n5. On perusal of the impugned order , the reference point No.9 refers to the reply filed by the petitioner dated\n4-3-2022. Then reference point No.8, say that an endorsement-cum-personal hearing notice was issued on 10-\n2-2022. Then at paragraph 42 of the impugned order , it was mentioned as if tax payer has requested to grant\npersonal hearing and the same was considered and granted. However , except this, in the impugned order , it is\nnot specifi cally mentioned as to what date was fixed for personal hearing after filing reply by the petitioner\nand what happened on the date i.e., whether the petitioner and his counsel were present or not. Be that as it\nmay, in the additional affidavit, at parag raph 4, it was mentioned that no opportu nity for personal hearing was\ngranted to the petitioner .\n6. In view of these facts, we are of the view that the petitioner was not afforded  an opportunity of personal\nhearing after he filed reply wherein he prayed for personal hearing. The reply  itself is a detailed one which\nruns into several pages containing several factual details and some legal  aspects. Therefore, the 1st\nrespondent, in our considered view , ought to have afforded personal hearing to the petitioner so as to\neffectively adjudicate all the issues involved in the process of assessment. Since that was not done, the\nimpugned order dated 25-7-2022 is liable to set aside.\n7.

Heard Sri Vemireddy Bhaskar Reddy , learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T ax.\n3. This matter is disposed of at the stage of admission as requested by Counsels on record.\nPetitioner's case in nutshell  :-\n4. Petitioner is a registered dealer on the rolls of the Assistant Commissioner (ST) Chittor -I under the\nprovisions of both CGST and SGST Act, 2017 and is engaged in the business  of purchase and sale of iron\nscrap. On 21-1-2023, the Assistant Commissioner (ST) Regional GST Audit and Enforcement Wing\nconducted inspectio n in the business premises of the petitioner and ascertained taxable amount of Rs.\n05,48,29,347/- including T ax, Penalty and interest  vide Orders under DRC-07.\n(b) Petitioner challenging the correctness of the Order passed by the Assessing  Authority carried the\nmatter before respondent No. 2 - Additi onal Commissioner (ST) and the Appel lant Authority , Tirupathi,\nChittor District under section 107 of the A.P. G.S.T Act, 2017 along with a request to condone delay of\n25 days in preferring the appeal. As the petitioner's accounts were frozen by the Department, he could not\nmobilize the funds required for pre-deposit of 10% of the disputed tax for filing appeal, which is\nmandatory .\n(c) The entire business transactions have come to a grinding halt due to the provisional attachment orders\nissued to the banks  as well as to the dealers to whom he has supplied goods and yet to receive the\nconsideration.\n(d) Respondent No. 2 rejected the appeal on untenable grounds  vide impugned Order dated 3-6-2023,\nsince the Appellate Tribunal is yet to be constituted, petitioners approached this Court challenging the\nimpugned order passed by the respondent No. 2.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that though the petition er preferred appeal within\ncondonable period of limitation, the Appellate Authority rejected the appeal without considering the genuine\nreason for the petitioner filing appeal with delay and passed the impugned Order, which is not tenable under\nlaw. Though it is the discretion of the appellate authority to condone the delay , discretion has to be exercised\njudiciously . The petitioner's bank accounts were frozen, notices issued to the dealers to whom he has supplied\nthe goods  and yet to receive the consideration. Learned Appellate Authority ought to have considered the\nreason for the delay since he was prevented by suf ficient cause and entertained the appeal.\n6. Per contra , learned Governme nt Pleader would submit that the impugned Order is a reasoned Order .\nLearned authority opined that the reason for the delay is not convincing. The petitioner , without giving any\ndetails of the financial  crisis his business faced, simply mentioned that he has faced unforeseen and severe\nfinancial  crisis. The plea regarding the difficulties in securing the loan amount also far from truth. Respondent\nNo. 2 rightly rejected the appeal and therefore, prays for dismissal of the petition.\n7. Having heard the submission of both counsel, now the points that would emer ge for determination are:\ni. Whether the petitioner was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the\nstatutory period of limitation ?\nii. To what relief ?\n8. To answer the points framed  supra , a keen perusal of the relevant provisi ons under the GST Act, 2017\nwould serve the purpose:\nSection 107 - Appeals to Appellate Authority\n(1) Any person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under this Act or the State Goods\nand Servi ces Tax Act or the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act by anadjudicating authori ty may appeal to such Appellate Authority as may be prescr ibed within\nthree months from the date on which the said decision or order is communica ted to such\nperson.\n(2) The Commissioner may, on his own motion, or upon request from the Commissioner of\nState tax or the Commissioner of Unio n territory tax, call for and examine the record of\nany proceedings in which an adjudicating authority has passed any decision or order under\nthis Act or the State Goods and Services Tax Act or the Union Territory Goods and\nServices Tax Act, for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the legality or propriety of the\nsaid decision or order and may, by order , direct any officer subordinate to him to apply to\nthe Appellate Authority within six months from the date of communication of the said\ndecision or order for the determination  of such points arising out of the said decision or\norder as may be specified by the Commissioner in his order .\n(3) Where, in pursuance of an order under sub-section (2), the authorized officer makes an\napplication to the Appellate Authority , such application shall be dealt with by the Appellate\nAuthority as if it were an appeal made  against the decision or order of the adjudicating\nauthority and such authorised officer were an appellant and the provisions of this Act\nrelating to appeals shall apply to such application.\n(4) The Appellate Authority may, if he is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by\nsufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the aforesaid period of three months or\nsix month s, as the case may be, allow  it to be presented within a further period of one\nmonth.\n(5) Every appeal under this section shall be in such form and shall be verified in such manner\nas may be prescribed.\n(6) No appeal shall be filed under sub-section (1), unless the appellant has paid\u2014\n(a) in full, such part of the amount of tax, interest, fine, fee and penalty arising from\nthe impugned order , as is admitted by him; and\n(b) a sum equal to ten per cent of the remaining amount of tax in dispute arising from\nthe said order ,( subject to a maximum of twenty-five crore rupees), in relation to\nwhich the appeal has been filed. Provid ed that no appeal shall be filed against an\norder under sub section (3) of the section 129, unless a sum equal to twenty five\npercent of the penalty has been paid by the appellant.\n(7) Where the appellant  has paid the amount under sub-section (6), the recovery proceedings\nfor the balance amount shall be deemed to be stayed.\n9. The word \"sufficien t cause\" as appearing in section 107(4) of CGST Act, 2017 for the purpose of seeking\ncondonation of delay in filing the appeal before the Commissioner (Appeal) has been interpreted by the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the light of section 5 of Limitation Act relating to Land Acquisition Matter would\nguide the Court in deciding the point. In Collector , Land Acquisition  v. Mst. Katiji AIR 1987  SC 1353/1987\ntaxmann.com 1072/1987 (28) EL T 185 (SC) .\nWhile deciding application under section 5 Limitation Act, \"justice oriented  approach\" is required to be\nadopted. The expre ssion 'sufficient cause' is adequately elastic to enable the courts to apply the law in a\nmeaningful manner which subserve the ends of justice that being the life-purpose for the existence of the\ninstitution  of Courts.\n10. Hon'ble Apex Court laid down the following principle to be followed while dealing with an application\nseeking condonation of delay:-\n\"1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.\n2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold\nand cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is condoned the highest that can\nhappen is that a cause would be decided on merits after hearing the parties.3. 'Every day's delay must be explained' does not mean that a pedantic approach should be made. Why\nnot every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must be applied in a rational common\nsense pragmatic manner .\n4. When substantial justice and technica l considerations are pitted against each other , cause of\nsubstantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in\ninjustice being done because of a nondeliberate delay .\n5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately , or on account of culpable negligence,\nor on account of  mala fide s. A litigan t does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay . In fact he runs\na serious risk.\"\n11. Needless to say that the Commissioner (appeals) been creature of statute is not vested with the jurisdiction\nto condone the delay beyond the permissible period provided under the statute. The period upto which the\nprayer for condonation can be accepted is clearly mentioned under section 107 (4).\n12. In Penuel Nexus (P.) Ltd. v. Additional Commissioner Head Quarters (Appeals)  2023 SCC Online Ker\n4243/ [2023] 152 taxmann.com 208 (Ker.). Kerala High Court . While interpreting Section 107 (4) observed\n\"the Central Goods and Services Tax Act is a special statute and a self-contained code by itself, and Section\n107 thereof is an inbuilt mechanism and has impliedly excluded the application of the Limitation Act. It is\ntrite, that the Limita tion Act will apply only if it is extended to the special statute. It is also rudimentary that\nthe provisions of a fiscal statute have to be strictly construed and interpreted\".\n13. While considering the application for condonation of delay , it is not the length  of the delay , but cause for\ndelay which would be paramount consideration. If the cause shown as indicated under section 107(4) of the\nact, such delay deserves to be condoned irrespective of the length of the delay. It does not mean that the\nlearned Commissioner (Appeals) can condone the delay beyond the condonable period that is one month after\nexpiry of three months after statutory period of three months.\n14. However , if the cause shown is not within the proximity of case or contrary to facts or irrespective\ndeliberate proof of material facts, the length of delay even if short cannot be accepted. It all depends on facts\nand circumstances of each case. They could not be in straight jacket formula prescribed for considering for the\ncause for delay .\n15. Coming to the facts of the present case, the petitioner filed appeal with a delay  of 25 days after expiry of\nthree months of statutory period of limit ation for filing appeal before Commissioner . The reasons assigned for\nthe delay are as follows :\n(a) The delay was caused due to an unforeseen and severe financial  crisis that his business has been\nfacing.\n(b) His bank account was freezed by the Assistant commissioner (ST), Regional GST Audit &\nEnforcement Office, Tirupati and his Input Tax Credit was also blocked. Hence he was unable to\npay the 10% of disputed tax as pre-deposit which is required to file the appeal.\n(c) He made several efforts to obtain the loan from the financial  institutions . He has finally obtained\nloan from his business associate with which he paid 10% of disputed tax as pre-deposit.\n16. As seen from the order impugned, the learned Commissioner opined that the reasons are not convincing.\nPertinent to say that, the learned Commissioner never denied about freezing of bank account of the petitioner\nand about issuing of notices to the purchasers who are yet to pay consideration to the petitioner .\n17. In this context it is necessary to refer section 107 (6) which is vivid on the point of deposit of 10% of the\ndisputed tax which is mandatory at the time of filing of the appeal. When the bank account of the petitioner is\nfreezed by the authorities, it is a relevan t fact to consider the delay since the pre-deposit of 10% disputed tax\nat the time of filing  of the appeal is mandatory . The view taken by the learned Commissioner appears to be\nforcing the horse to run after tying the legs. The right of appeal which is created under statute is a substantive\nright of the party that cannot be denie d by taking pedantic view . We are not convinced with the reasons\nassigned by the learned Commissioner in rejecting the appeal. Since, it is within the condonable period of\nlimitation as the cause for the delay is suffice to entertain the appeal. On appreciation of the language\nemployed under section 107 (4) and in the back drop the factual and legal backg round, we are of the view that\nthe impugned order deserves to be set aside.SB18. In the result, the Writ Petition is allowed. The impugned order passed by respon dent No. 2 dated 3-6-2023\nis set aside. Respondent No. 2 is direct ed to restore the appeal and dispose of the matter according to law.\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any , pending shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

JAIN3. The petitioner claims to be the owner of vehicle which had been detained by the authorities on the plea that\nno docum ent with regard to movemen t of the goods being carried by the vehicle i.e., granite slabs was\nproduced when the vehicle was stopped for physical verification.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is the owner of the truck and being\ntransporter has nothing to do with the goods as he was hired by the granite factory to transport the granite\nslabs from Prakasam District to Maharastra.\n5. Learned counsel submitted that law does not permit any detention of vehicle as only the concerned\nconsignment/goods is liable to the same. Learned counsel relied upon various judgments of Coordinate\nBenches in which after putting certain conditions, the vehicle has been directed to be released in favour of the\nowner .\n6. Learned Government Pleader , Commercial Tax, submitted that the action of the authorities is under the\nAndhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, 'A.P.G.S.T . Act') and Section 129(2) thereof\nclearly provides for detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyances in transit. Thus, it was contended\nthat the law does not make any distinction between the conveyances and the goods and, in the present case,\nadmittedly , no papers or documents were produced relating to the granite, which was subject to taxation under\nthe A.P.G.S.T . Act, leading to a presumption that there was evasion and the authorities have rightly detained\nthe vehicle in question. Further , it was submitted that the authorities have also issued notice to the person\nconcerned under FORM GST MOV -02. Learned counsel submitted that in the notice form itself, opportunity\nto show cause within seven days after receipt of the notice is given and also a date is given for appearance.\nThus, learned couns el submitted that sufficient safeguard against violation of principles of natural justice and\ngiving reasonable opportunity of hearing are self contained. It was submitted that the petitioner should get the\nproceedings concluded as per the provisions of A.P.G.S.T . Act. Further , with regard to the contention that he\nis a mere transporter , learned counsel submitted that the same is a matter of fact between the petitioner and the\nowner of the goods, which besides requiring proof, cannot also be a matter of consideration under the\nprovisions of the A.P.G.S.T . Act, as admittedly , it was the vehicle in question on which the finished granite\nwas being transported and upon interception, valid papers have not been furnished till date.\n7. Learned counsel further submitted that the Supreme Court, in the judgment dated 22-11-2019, in State of\nUttar Pradesh  v. Kay Pan Fragrance (P.) Ltd. [2019] 112 taxmann .com 81/[2020] 77 GST 576 has observed\nthat the High Court ought to have been loathe to entertain the writ petitions questioning the seizure of goods\nand to issue directio ns for its release and further that the High Court, in all such cases, ought to have relegated\nthe assessees before the appropriate Authority for complying with the procedure prescribed as applicable for\nrelease (including provisional release) of the seized goods.\n8. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for the\nparties, the Court is not inclined to interfere in the matter . Keeping in mind the provisions of section 129(2) of\nA.P.G.S.T . Act, as also that once such proceeding has been initiated, the same is now required to be taken to\nits logical conclusion.\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition stands disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to get the proceeding which\nhas already been initiated by the authorities taken to its logical conclusion , besides praying before the\nauthorities concerned for provisional release of the vehicle, which shall be considered by the authorities\nconcerned in accordance with law expeditiously .

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioners implore for writ of mandamus declaring the order dated 4-2-2 020\npassed by 1st respondent confiscating 69 Kgs of silver ornaments worth Rs. 28,00,000/- and directing the\npetitioners to pay tax of Rs. 84,000/- (Central Tax and State Tax), penalty of Rs. 84,000/-and fine of Rs.\n26,32,000/- in lieu of confiscation, as without authorization as contemplated under section 67 of the Central\nGoods and Service Act, 2017 (for short , 'CGST Act'), arbitrary , without jurisdiction and consequently to set\naside the confiscation proceedings.\n2. The petitioners' case succinctly is thus:\n(a) 1st petitio ner is the Proprietrix of M/s. Sangeetha Jewellers, Madhugiri Town, Karnataka State,\ndoing business in silver ornaments and a registered dealer under the Goods and Service Tax Act,\n2017 since May, 2018, having GST Registration No. 29GZIPS5843AIZZ. The 2nd petitioner is her\nhusband and 3rd petitioner is the brother -in-law of 1st petitioner .\n(b) As the business of 1st petitioner was not up to the mark, they decided to shift their business from\nMadhugiri to Pavagada Town in Karnataka. On 15-1-2020, at about 06.30 A.M. when the\npetitioners along with one Smt. J. Devi, the grand mother of 2nd petitioner , were proceeding in their\nvehicle Creta bearing No. KA 06Z 1813 along with accounts and stock of 69 Kgs of silver\nornaments to the newly established business premises at Pavagada, which was taken on lease on 1-\n12-2019, on the way the 2nd responde nt intercepted their vehicle at Y.B. Halli Check Post and\nseized the silver ornaments and vehicle under the cover of panchanama, on the ground that there\nwere no supporting documents. Thereaft er, the 2nd respondent handed over the seized ornaments to\nthe 4th respondent. Hence, the petitioner s approached the 4th respondent, who in turn directed them\nto approac h 1st respondent. According ly, the 1st petitioner approached the 1st respondent and\nproduced all the business records for verification to show the justification of the transaction and\nthus, accounted for the stock. However , the 1st respondent did not consider the explanation of 1st\npetitioner and the books of accounts produced by her but blindly followed the Panchanama\nrecorded by 2nd respondent. The 1st respondent issued a notice of confiscation in Form GST\nMOU-10, dated 21-1-2020, which was served on 2nd petitioner on 25-1-2020. Against which the\n1st petitio ner filed a detailed explanatio n dated 28-1-2020 by enclosing all the relevant documents\nstating that the seized stock of 69 Kgs of silver ornaments were purchased from the registered GST\ndealers covered by proper invoice and GST tax and the same ornaments were being shifted to the\nnew business premises at Pavagada. The goods were thus accounted for and suffered tax and hence,\nthe proposed levy of tax and penalty was not justified.\n(c) However , without considering the aforesaid explanation the 1st respondent treated the seized stock\nas unaccounted for and rejected the contention of the petitioners and passed the impugned order .\n(d) The order of the 1st respondent is highly arbitrary and contrary to the facts and circumstances of the\ncase, besides 1st respondent has no authorization as contemplated under section 67 of the CGST\nAct.\n Hence, the writ petition.\n3. 1st respondent filed counter and while denying the petition averments, inter alia  contended thus:\n(a) It is contended that for inspection of the goods in movement, Section 68 of the State Goods and\nService Tax Act, 2017 (SGST Act) will apply but not Section 67 of the said Act as claimed by the\npetitioners. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner (ST) is the authorised officer as per the Gazette\nNotification No. 37 dated 30-6-2017, Revenue Department (CT-II) proceedings of the Chief\nCommissioner of State Tax, Andhra Pradesh. Hence, the contention of the petitioners that 1st\nrespondent without authorisation issued the impugned proceedings is false and misleading.(b) The 2nd respondent intercepted the petitioners' vehicle on 15-1-2020 and seized the silver\nornaments and vehicle and intimated the said fact to 4th respondent on 17-1-202 0. He informed that\nat the time of interce ption Sri Prakash, S/o. Nemaram & Sri Mohan Lal, S/o. Bhikaram, Madhugiri,\nTumkuru District were inchar ge of goods & vehicle. He further informed that they were conveying\n69 Kgs of silver ornaments worth Rs. 28.00 lakhs without having any bills and supporting\ndocuments and without paying GST. Therefore, he prepared mahazarnama in the presence of\nrevenue of ficials and kept the goods and the conveyance in his safe custody .\n(c) The 4th respondent in his turn, while forwarding the records (a) letter of the Inspe ctor of Police,\nMadakasira Circle dated 15-1-2020 (b) Mahazarnama recorded in the presence of revenue officials\ndated 15-1-2020, authorised the Deputy Assistant Commissioner (ST)-1, Hindupur to take further\naction in the matter since the petitioners have violated Section 68 r/w Rule 138A (a) of the SGST\nAct and Rules 2017. It is further clear that the petitioners intended to evade the payment of\nlegitimate tax due for the consignment. Accordingly , Form MOV -01, Form MOV -06 dated 20-1-\n2020 (Order of Detention) were prepared and when the persons in-char ge of the goods were\nrequested to take the notices, they simply left the place stating that they would  come later, but did\nnot turn up. In that view , the assessing authority served notices by affixture i.e., affixing to the\nconveyance bearing No. KA06Z1813 which was stationed at Madakasira Police Station through Sri\nK. Anjaneyulu, Office Subordinate in the presence of two witnesses. A copy of the order was\nserved on second respondent. Further , since the person in-char ge of the conveyance has not turned\nup, a notice in Form MOV -10 dated  21-1-2020 was served by affixture through the Office\nSubordinate in the presence of two witnesses. Hence, the contention of the petitioners that no\nstatutory notices were served is false.\n(d) The contention of the petitioners that they were shifting their business from Madhugiri to Pavagada\nis an afterthought. If the said contention is true, their address in the registration certificate should\nappear as Pavagada but not Madhugiri but their address in the registration certificate still appears as\nMadhugiri.\n(e) It is further contended that Form MOV -07 & MOV -09 were not issued because the action was\ninitiated under sectio n 130 of the SGST Act, 2017. The petitioners' allegation that they were served\non them is wrong.\n(f) It is conten ded that if the petitioners are aggrieved by the affixing order , there is a recourse for them\nto file an appeal under the Act and in that view , the writ petition is not maintainable. The action\ntaken by the respond ent authorities is perfectly valid under law and therefore, the writ petition may\nbe dismissed.\n4. The petitioners filed reply af fidavit denying the counter averments as thus:\n(a) It is contended that the action of 1st respondent in directly invoking/initiating the confiscation\nproceedings by issuing confiscation notice in GST MOV -10 dated 21-1-2020 and thereupon passing\nthe confisc ation proceedings dated 4-2-2020 under section 130 of the SGST Act is highly arbitrary\nand contra ry to the scheme of the Act and without jurisdiction and author ity under law. The\nrespondents made contradictory stateme nts, as, at one breath they stated as if notices under Form\nMOV -07 & MOV -09 were served on the petitioners by affixture on their convey ance and in another\nbreath they stated, notices under MOV -07 & MOV -09 were not required to be served since action\nwas initia ted under section 130. It is further contended that the 1st respondent acted in\ncontravention of Section 129(6) of the SGST Act. Even assuming that the notice dated 20-1-2020\nwas issued , without waiting for 14 days from the said date, he ought not to have issued confiscation\nnotice on the same day. Thus, the confi scation notice dated 21-1-2020 issued under section 130 of\nthe SGST Act is not valid in the eye of law. It is further contended that the petitioners have\nexplained to the authorities that they were shifting their business from Madhugiri to Pavadaga and\nthe left over stock of 69 Kgs of silver ornaments were being shifted to the new business premises.\nIn support of their case the petitione rs filed various documents. The respondent authorities,\nhowever , not properly considered the explanation of the petitioners dated 28-1-2020 and their\ndocuments. Hence, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.\n5. Heard the arguments of Sri Sk. Jeelani Basha, learned counsel for petitioners, and Sri Y.N. Vivekananda,\nlearned Government Pleader for Commercial T axes-II representing the respondents.6. Vociferously challenging the confisca tion proceedings dated 4-2-2020 of the 1st respondent, learned\ncounsel for the petitioners Sri Jeelani Basha would argue that the 1st petitioner conducted business in silver\nornaments under the name and style \"M/s. Sangeetha Jewellers\" for about 20 months in Madhugiri Town and\nthey used to purchase the silver ornaments from registered GST dealers under proper invoice and paid GST\ntax and they used to maintain all accounts perfectly . His further submission is that when their business was not\nin flourishing condition in Madhugiri, they proposed to shift from that place to Pavagada town and in fact the\npetitioners have taken a shop on lease at Pavagada  vide Rent Deed dated 1-12-2019. Thus, the petitioners have\nshifted from Madhugiri to Pavagada on 15-1-2020 in the vehicle bearing No. KA 06Z 1813 along with their\nleft over silver ornaments weighing about 69180.824 grams. Learned counsel further ar gued that on the way at\nMadakasira, the 2nd respondent interce pted the vehicle and the petitioners promptly intimated him that the\nstock of 69180.824 grams of silver ornaments already suffered tax under SGST Act. However , without\nheeding to their submission, the 2nd respondent detained the silver ornaments and conveyance and handed\nover them to 4th respondent without issuing any detention notice under section 129 of the SGST Act.\nHowever , 1st respondent issued them a show cause notice MOV -10 dated 21-1-2020 under section 130, as to\nwhy the stock and conveyance shall not be confiscated which was received by petitioners on 25-1-2020. The\npetitioners submitte d a detailed explana tion dated 28-1-2020 along with necessary documents showing the\nstock had already suffered tax under the SGST Act. Without appreciating the detailed explanation and the\ndocuments filed in support of their version, 1st respondent passed the impugned confiscation proceedings\nwhich is contrary to law .\n(a) Learned counsel impugned the confi scation proceedings on two main grounds. Firstly , the\nauthorities cannot undertake the confi scation proceedings under section 130 of the SGST Act\nstraight away without first exhausting the procedure contemplated under section 129 of the SGST\nAct. The authorities  have not issued the detention notice and 14 days time stipulated under section\n129 of the SGST Act. As the proce dure under section 129 is not religiously followed, the\nconsequent proceedings under section 130 of the SGST Act are therefore, null and void.\n(b) Secondly , he argued, 1st respondent has not given an opportunity to the petitioners to establish their\ncase nor he objectively analysed and assessed the probative value of the documents produced by the\npetitioners along with their explanation to show that the detained stock had already suffered the tax\nunder the SGST Act. 1st respondent, without giving any plausible reasons, simply rejected the\ndocuments on an untenable ground that they were fabricated with an afterthought. Learned counsel\nvehemently argued that the 1st respondent cannot brand the documents produced by the petitioners\nas afterthought without assigning any reason. The documents such as monthly returns etc., cannot\nbe manipulated by the petitioners since, they were maintained over a long perio d during the course\nof their day-to-day business. Hence, without making an objective analysis it is not apt on the part of\nthe 1st respondent to reject them on the ground that they were created by an afterthought. Had a\nreasonable opportunity been given, the petitioners would have established the genuinity of all the\ndocuments relied upon by them. He placed reliance on the decision in Sneh Enterprises  v.\nCommissioner . of Customs . 2006 taxmann.com  1512 (SC)  to canvass the point that the tax statutes\nneed strict interpretation and submitted that since the respondent authorities did not follow the\nprocedure contempl ated under section 129 of the SGST Act and failed to issue notices thereunder ,\nthe further  proceedi ngs are vitiated. He impugned the proceedings of 1st respondent also on the\nground that under section 67 of the SGST Act the Joint Commissioner , but not the 1st respondent,\nhas authority to act upon. He thus prayed to set aside  the impugned proceedings and issue\nappropriate directions to the respondent authorities.\n7. In oppugnation, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes - II firstly argued that in respect of the\ntaxable goods in transit, like in the prese nt case, Section 68 of the CGST (Sectio n 68 of the SGST Act in pari\nmateria) is applicable but not Section 67 as contended by the petitioners. He would submit that as per Section\n68 r/w. Rule 138, the person in-char ge of a conveyance, before commencement of the movement of the goods\nfrom one place to its destination, shall obtain an e-way bill (electronic way bill) by feeding required\ninformation in the common portal maintained by the respondent Department and carry with him such e-way\nbill and other required documents throughout the journey . Failing which the \"Proper Officer\" who is\nauthorised under section 68 of the CGS T Act can intercept the vehicle and on the failure of the person in-\ncharge of the conveyance to produce the e-way bill and other related documents, can take action under section\n129 and also 130 of the CGST Act. He would submit that as per the Gazette Notification No. 37 of Revenue\nDepartment (CT-II) dated 30-6-2017, the Proper Officer with reference to Section 68(3) for inspection of\ngoods in movement, among others, is the Deputy Assistant Commissioner i.e., 1st respon dent. He would thussubmit that the 1st respondent is legally authorised to pass the impugned proceedings and the contention in\ncontra is untenable.\n(a) Secondly , he argued that on 15-1-2020 the Inspector of Police, Madakasira intercepted the vehicle\nand found 69180.824 grams of silver ornaments in the vehicle. He enquired the petitioners 2 and 3\nwho were in the car about the e-way bill and other documents. They admitted to have not paid the\ntax while purchasing those silver ornaments and went away stating that they would come soon.\nTherefore, the 2nd respondent handed over the goods and vehicle to 4th respond ent who authorised\n1st respondent to take up the proceedin gs. Learned Government Pleader further argued that since\nthe petitioners failed to produce relevant documents and did not turn up, he decided to take up the\nproceedings under sections 129 & 130 of the CGST Act. Accordingly , he issued Form GST MOV -6\nnotice of detention dated 20-1-2020 under section 129(1). As there were none to receive, he got\naffixed the said notice on the vehicle. Learned Government Pleader would submit that since the 1st\nrespondent proposed to proceed under section 130 also, he did not issue notice in Form GST MOV -\n07 under section 129(3) of the CGST Act specifying the tax and penalty payable on the seized\ngoods and conveyance. He further argued that 1st respondent then issued a Form GST MOV -10\nunder section 130 directing the petitioners to show cause within 14 days as to why the seized goods\nshall not be confiscated and the said notice was also affixed on the vehicle.  Apart from it, 1st\nrespondent also got issued a personal hearing notice dated 30-1-2020 under section 130(4) of the\nCGST Act fixing the date 3-2-2020 for personal hearing which was received by the auditor of the\npetitioners and 1st petitioner submitted  a written explanation dated 28-1-2020 . However , having\nfound the conduct of the petitioners in not carrying relevant documents along with them during the\ntransit and leaving the place of detention without receiving the notices and not submitting the\ndocuments atleast immediately thereafter but only producing some documents  along with written\nexplanation belatedly , the 1st respondent concluded that the petitioners' plea that they paid GST on\nthe detained goods long before was an afterthought and accordingly , passed the impugned\nproceedings dated 4-2-2020. He thus claimed that the order was perfectly valid and passed after\nissuing the relevant notices and by follo wing due process contemplated under sections 129 & 130\nof the CGST Act.\n(b) Thirdly , he ar gued that Section 129 & 130 of the CGST Act are independent and mutually exclusive\nand theref ore, the authorities can adopt both of them simultaneously . To buttress this argument, he\nrelied upon Syner gy Fertichem (P .) Ltd . v. State of Gujarat [2019] 112 taxmann.com  370 (Guj.) . He\nthus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n8. The points for consideration are:\n(1) Whether the 1st respondent is authorised to pass the impugned proceedings dated 4-2-2020?\n(2) Whether the 1st respondent is legally justified in proceeding simultaneously under section 129 &\n130 of the CGST Act against the petitioners?\n(3) Whether the order dated 4-2-2020 of the 1st respondent is legally sustainable?\n9. Point No. 1 : On perusal of record, we hold the argument of the petitioners that the 1st respondent is not\nlegally authorised to issue the impugned proceedings is not correct in view of the Gazette notification No. 37\nof Revenue Department (CT-II) dated 30-6-2017 filed by the learned Government Pleader . Section 68(3) of\nthe CGST  Act confers power on \"the Proper Officer\" to intercept any conveyance on the way and require the\nperson in-char ge of the said conveyance to produce the documents prescribed under sub-section (1) of Section\n68 and the devices for verification in which case the said person shall be liable to produce the same and also\nallow the inspection  of goods. While so, in the Gazette notification No. 37, the Chief Commissioner of State\nTax notified certain officers as \"Proper Officer\" occurring in different sections of the SGST Act. In Serial No.\n23, certain officers  viz., (i) Goods and Service  Tax Officer (ii) Deputy Assistant Commissioner (iii) Assistant\nCommissioner (iv) Deputy Commissioner and (v) Joint Commissioner having jurisdictio n and/or (i) Deputy\nAssistant Commissioner (ii) Assistant Commissioner and (iii) Deputy Commissi oner as authorised by the\nadditional Commiss ioner/Commissioner in case of State Enforcement Wing are authorised as \"Proper\nOfficers\" to act under section 68(3).\n(a) While so, by an amendment  vide Ref. No. CCW/GST/74/2015 dated 28-3-2018 the Commissioner\nof Comme rcial Taxes authorized the officer not below the cadre of 'Deputy Assistant Commissionerof State Tax' as 'Proper Officer' for the purpose of Section 68(3). In the instant case, the\nconfiscation proceed ings are issued by the Deputy Assistant Commissioner (ST)-I, Hindupur , the\nfirst respondent herein, who is authorised as per the above Gazette notification.\n10. Point No. 2 : Admittedly , in this case the goods i.e., 69180.824 grams of silver ornaments were detained\nwhile in transport. Section 68 r/w Rule 138, 138A, Section 129 & 130 will apply to the present instance. As\nalready discussed in Point No. 1 supra , under section 68 while taxable goods are under conveyance, the\nProper Officer can intercept and require the in-char ge of the conveyance for the necessary documents and\ndevices and also inspect the goods. While so, Rule 138 of the CGST Rules, 2017 says that every registered\nperson who causes movement of goods  of the consignment value exceeding Rs. 50,000/- shall furnish the\ninformation relating  to the said goods electronically on the common portal and obtain a e-way bill. Then Rule\n138A prescribes the documents and devices to be carried by a person in-char ge of a conveyance. It lays down\nthus:\n138A. (1) The person-in-char ge of a conveyance shall carry\u2014\n(a) the invoice or bill of supply or delivery challan, as the case may be; and\n(b) a copy of the e-way bill in physical form or the e-way bill number in electronic form or\nmapped to a Radio Frequency Identification Device embedded on to the conveyance in\nsuch manner as may be notified by the Commissioner:\nProvided  that nothi ng contain ed in clause (b) of this sub-rule shall apply in case of movement of goods\nby rail or by air or vessel.\n ** ** **\n(a) Rule 138B deals with verification of documents and conveyances. This provision says that\nthe Proper Officer who is authorized in this behalf can intercept any conveyanc e to verify\nthe e-way bill in physical or electronic form for all interstate and intrastate movement of\nthe goods. He can also make a physical verification of the conveyance.\n11. Com ing to the facts, on 15-1-2020 when the petitioners were proceeding in their vehicle Creta bearing No.\nKA 06Z 1813 along with 69180.824 grams of silver , 2nd respondent intercepted them at Y.B. Halli Check\nPost and having found large quantity of silver ornaments, enquired the petitioners about the relevant\ndocuments. The 2nd petitioner seems to have stated that they were shifting their business from Madhugiri\nTown to Pavagada and for that purpose they were carrying the silver wear . The 2nd petitioner alleged to have\nadmitted that they did not pay the GST to the Government. On that the 2nd respondent prepared the\nPanchanama in the presence of mediators and handed over the seized stock and conveyance to 4th respondent.\nThus, according to the respondents, the petitioners did not produce any docume nts like e-way bill, invoice/tax\nreceipts etc. as stipulated under section 68 r/w 138 & 138A of the CGST Act and its Rules.\n12. Then according to 4th respondent, he issued Form GST MOV -06 detention notice under section 129(1) of\nthe CGST  Act to the petitioners and as they were not available, got affixed on the vehicle in the presence of\nthe mediators. According to him, since the petitioners failed to produce any documents, he proposed to initiate\nthe confiscation proceedings also and hence, he issued Form GST MOV -10 confiscation notice under section\n130 of the CGST Act to the petitioners  to show cause within 14 days as to why the goods and conveyance\nshall not be confiscated and the said notice was also affixed on the vehicle in the presence of the mediators.\nLearned Government Pleader produced the copies of Form GST MOV -6 and Form GST MOV -10 along with\ncounter . Therefore, the contention of the petitioners that no notices were issued to them as prescribed under\nlaw cannot be countenanced.\n13. Now the crucial question is whether the 1st respondent is justified in proceeding simultaneously under\nsection 129 & 130 of the CGST Act against the petitioners. It is the contention  of the petitioners that Section\n129 and 130 are interrelated and interd ependent, as, the confiscation proceedings under section 130 can be\ntaken only when the in-char ge of a conveyance failed to pay tax and penalty for the transported goods within\n14 days of detention as prescribed in section 129(6) of the CGST Act. Whereas, learned Government Pleader\ntraversed said plea and argued that both the sections are mutually exclusive and procedures contemplated\nwhereof can be followed simultaneously .14. In Syner gy Fertichem (P.) Ltd. (supra  2), a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dealt with the\nprecise question as to whether section 129 & 130 of CGST Act overlap or are independent to each other . On\nan elaborate discussion, they gave their final conclusions as follows:\n'(i) Section 129 of the Act talks about detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyances in\ntransit. On the other hand, section 130 talks about confiscation of goods or conveyance and levy of\ntax, penalty and fine thereof. Although, both the sections start with a non-obstante  clause, yet, the\nharmonious reading of the two sectio ns, keeping in mind the object and purpose behind the\nenactment thereof, would indicate that they are independent of each other . Section 130 of the Act,\nwhich provides for confiscation of the goods or conveyance is not, in any manner , dependent or\nsubject to section 129 of the Act. Both the sections ar e mutually exclusive . (Emphasis Supplied ).\n(ii) The phrase \"with an intent to evade the payment of tax\" in Section 130 of the Act assumes\nimportance. When the law requires an intention to evade payment of tax, then it is not mere failure\nto pay tax. It must be something more. The word \"evade\" in the context means defeating the\nprovisions of law of paying tax. It is made more stringent by use of the word \"intent\". The assessee\nmust deliberately avoid the payment of tax which is payable in accor dance with law. However , the\nelement of  mens r ea cannot be r ead into Section 130 of the Act . (Emphasis Supplied ).\n(iii) For the purpose of issuing a notice of confiscation under section 130 of the Act at the threshold, i.e.,\nat the stage of detention and seizure of the goods and conveyance, the case has to be of such a\nnature that on the face of the entire transaction, the authority concerned should  be convinced that\nthe contravention was with a definite  intent to evade payment of tax. The action, in such\ncircumstances, should be in good faith and not be a mere pretence. In other words, the authorities\nneed to make out a very strong case. Mere suspicion may not be sufficient to invoke Section 130 of\nthe Act straightway .\n(iv) If the authorities are of the view that the case is one of invoking section 130 of the Act at the very\nthreshold, then they need to record their reasons for such belief in writing, and such reasons\nrecorded in writing should, thereafter , be looked into by the superior authority so that the superior\nauthority can take an appropriate decis ion whether the case is one of straightw ay invoking section\n130 of the Act . (Emphasis Supplied ).\n(v) Even if the goods or the conveyance is released upon payment of the tax and penalty under section\n129 of the Act, later, if the authorities find something incriminating against the owner of the goods\nin the course of the inquiry , if any, then it would be permissible to them to initiate the confiscation\nproceedings under section 130 of the Act.\n(vi) Section 130 of the Act is not dependent on sub-section (6) of Section 129 of the Act. (Emphasis\nSupplied ).\n(vii) Sections 129 and 130 respectively of the Act are mutually exclusive and independent of each other .\n(Emphasis Supplied ). If the amount of tax and penalty , as determined under section 129 of the Act\nfor the purpose of release of the goods and the conveyance, is not deposited within the statutory\ntime period, then the consequence of the same would be forfeiture of the goods and the vehicle with\nthe Gover nment. This does not necessarily imply that the confiscation proceedings can be initiated\nonly in the event of the failure on the part of the owner of the goods or the conveyance in\ndepositing the amount towards the tax and liability determined under section 129 of the Act.\n(viii) For the purpose of section 129(6) of the Act, it would not be necessary for the department to\nestablish any intention to evade payment of tax. If the tax and penalty , as determined under section\n129, is not deposited within the statutory time period, then the goods and the conveyance shall be\nliable to be put to auction and the sale proceeds shall be deposited with the Government.\n(ix) xxx\n(x) xxx\n(xi) xxx\n(xii) xxx(xiii) xxx\n(xiv) xxx\n(xv) xxx\n(xvi) xxx\n ** ** **'\n15. We have, cautiousl y and meticulously gone through the above judgment. It is held therein that both the\nsections, though commenced with a non obstante  clause, yet are mutually exclusive and independent. It\nimplies that the confiscation proceedings can be taken up by the authorities after exhausting the measures\nunder section 129(6) and also simultane ously along with Section 129 and there is no bar. However , since the\nphrase \"with an intent to evade the payment of tax\" is employed in Section 130 of the Act, before invoking the\nconfiscation proceedings under section 130 at the threshold, the concerned authority must form a firm opinion\nthat the assessee has deliberately avoid ed the payment of tax. Such opinion must be an express one and\nrecorded with the reasons. It must be noted that except arguing that the autho rities cannot invoke both the\nsections simultaneously , the petitioners have not produced any case law which militates against the views\nexpressed in the above judgment.\n(a) Therefore, while fully subscribing the above views of the Gujarat High Court, we wish to add one\nmore aspect. As for invoking Section 130 at the threshold, the authority need to record his reasons\nfor his belief that the assessee has deliberately avoided the payment of tax, so also, during the\ncourse of enquiry under section 130, the authority shall, in terms of Section 130(4), afford an\nopportunity of hearing to the person whose goods and conveyance are sought to be confiscated and\nrecord cogent reasons for rejecting the contention of the owner .\nThis point is answered accordingly .\n16. Point No. 3 : With the above jurisprudence holding that the authority can simultaneously proceed under\nsection 129 and 130 of the CGST Act, we have scrutinized the impugned confiscation order dated 4-2-2019\npassed by the 1st respondent. As against the confiscation notice under Form MOV -10 dated 21-1-2020,\nadmittedly the 1st petitioner submitted her explanation along with documents mentioned therein. Hence,\ninitially we perused her explanation. Her case precisely is that the 69 KGs silver ornaments under transport\nwere related to M/s. Sangeetha Jewellers, Madhugiri for which she is the Proprietrix and those silver\nornaments were purchased by the petitio ners from the registered GST dealers covered by proper invoice and\nGST tax was already paid. Due to some unfavourable conditions, she stated, the business was shifted from\nMadhugiri to Pavagada by taking a shop on lease and on the detained day, they were taking the left over stock\nof 69 KGs of silver ornaments to Pavagada which was totally accounted for. It is her grievance that in spite of\ntheir explanation to the 2nd respondent, he detained the goods and conveyance and handed over to 4th\nrespondent. She filed the following documents:\n(1) Copy of registration certificate\n(2) Copy of monthly returns filed in GSTR-3B\n(3) Copies of all purchase and sale bills\n(4) Copies of Sales and Purchase extracts of ledger\n(5) Copies of lease rental agreement\n(6) Copies of Income-tax Returns filed\n(7) Trading, Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet for 2018-19 Financial Year i.e., from 3-05-2018 to 31-\n03-2019\n(8) Trading account copy from 1-04-2019 to 14-01-2020 disclosing a closing stock of 69180.824 grms\nof silver ornaments\n17. Then a perusal of the confiscation order shows that the above explanation of the petitioners was rejected\non three grounds, which, we constrained to hold, are neither logically nor legally tenable. Firstly , it wasS.K. JAINobserved that during the check held on 15-1-2020 while the goods were intransit, they did not produce any\ndocuments as prescribed under section 68 r/w Rule 138 and hence, goods are liable for confiscation.\n(a) Admittedly , the petitioners have not produced records pertaining to the silver ornaments at the time\nof initial check. However , that cannot be the sole ground to reject the record which was later\nproduced along with explanation. It must not be forgotten that confiscation under section 130 is a\ndrastic step which will denude the citizen of his right over his property . Therefore, to deprive him of\nit, the authority must not only afford a personal hearing to the owner in terms of Section 130(4) of\nCGST Act, but also adduce cogent reasons for discarding the explanation offered by him. Mere\nnon-production of the records at the inception, will not automatically falsify the records produced\nlater. The order must reflect the reason s as to why and how the records are fudged and spurious\nones.\n18. The secon d apparen t reason for discarding the explanation is that the contention s of the first petitioner are\nafterthought and have no relevance. This by no means a ground to reject the explanation. As already stated\nsupra , mere branding the explanation as afterthought without assigning reasons as to how the documents are\nfabricated ones will not make the order legally justified. The falsity of the records shall be established by\nanalysing the records but not simply branding them as afterthought.\n19. The third  reason is that though a personal hearing was granted on 3-2-202 0 the petitioners have not\navailed the same. This reason is also quite inadequate, as the petitioners have already filed their explanation\nalong with record. Therefore, without scrutinizing the said record in terms of the explanation and not noting\nany adverse comments on the probativ e value and genuinity of the said record, it was not apposite for 1st\nrespondent to reject the contention of the petitioners. It should be made clear that the orders of Public Servants\nsome of whom are quasi judicial authorities, which have the far reaching effect on the life, liberty , property\nand welfar e of the public must be based  on cogent reasons. The reason is the live nerve of an order . In Sneh\nEnterprises  (1 supra ) the Hon'ble apex court held that the Tax Statutes need strict interpretation. It follows\nthat while interpreting the Tax Statutes and applying to the facts and holding that the provisions thereof are\nviolated, the author ities must give cogent reasons. Unfortunately , in the instant case, the reasons, are a\ncasualty . Therefore, the impugned order does not stand to legal scrutiny and liable to be set aside.\nIt is argued by learned Government Pleader that since provision for appeal against the impugned order is\nprovided by the statute under section 107 of CGST Act, the writ petition is not maintainable. The facts and\nlaw involv ed in this case do not perm it us to agree with the said contention. It is true that an alternative\nremedy is available in the form of Section 107 of CGST Act. However , it must not be forgotten that the\npetitioners herein challenged the jurisdictional authority of 1st respondent to pass the impugned order .\nBesides, they also pleaded that principle s of natural justice have not been follow ed and a fair opportunity was\nnot afforded to them to establish their defence. In Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks  AIR\n1999 SC 22, the apex court observed thus.\n\"15. Unde r article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has\ndiscretion to entertain or not to enterta in a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself\ncertain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court\nwould not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been consistently held by this\nCourt not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely , wher e the Writ Petition has been\nfiled for the enfor cement of any of the Fundamental rights or wher e there has been a violation of the\nprinciple of natural justice or wher e the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires\nof an Act is challenged . (Emphasis Supplied ).\nTherefore, we are unable to agree with the above contention of learned Government Pleader .\n20. In the result, this writ petition is allowed and while the confiscation order dated 4-2-2020 passed by the 1st\nrespondent is set aside, the 1st respondent is directed to conduct an enquiry afresh and afford an opportunity\nof personal hearing to the petitioners with reference to their explanation and pass an appropriate order by\ngiving cogent reasons in accordance with law. The entire exercise shall be completed within eight (8) weeks\nfrom the date of receipt of a copy of this order . Till then, the detention of subject goods and conveyance shall\nhold good. No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

Nar endra Chetty , Adv . for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner challenges the Assessment, Penalty & Interest order beari ng\nNo.DIN3715122281260 dated 15.12.2022 passed by 1st respondent under the SGST and CGST Acts 2017 for\nthe tax periods 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 (upto November 2019) as without jurisdiction, without\nauthority , contrary to law and violative ofprinciples of natural justice and set aside the said order .\n2. The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) The petitioner challenged the earlier Assessment Order dated 24.06.2020 on the ground that no\npersonal hearing was accorded to the petitioner before passing such order and in\nW.P.No.22198/2020, this Court passed an order dated 15.03.2021 and remanded the matter to 1st\nrespondent with a direction to afford personal hearing to the petitioner and to pass Assessment\nOrder afresh on merits. Thereafter , the present impugned order dated 15.12.2022 was passed.\n(b) The petitioner engaged in plying passenger buses in different States i.e., Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, Tamilnad u and Puducherry . The 1st respondent obtained information from M/s Abhibus\nand wrong ly assessed petitioner to tax in respect of the total turnover of the petitioner relating to all\nthe four States. As per statute, the 1st respondent has to assess the petitioner to tax in respect of the\nturnover relating to A.P. State only and the turnover relates to other States will be excisable to tax\nas per the relevant statute of those States. Therefore, the impugned Assessment Order is\nunsustainable.\n(c) The petitioner inter alia argued that the Joint Commissioner (ST), Chittoor issued authorization in\nForm GST INS-01 to the 2nd respond ent only for conducting inspection / auditing and not for\nmaking assessment,  for which a separate Post Audit / Post Inspection, authorization is required to\nbe issued by the Joint Commissioner (ST). However , such an authorization was not issued to the\n2nd respondent. Further , the 2nd respondent has not passed the Assessment Order but the 1st\nrespondent, who is not the jurisdictional Assessing Authority of the petitioner and who is not the\nProper Officer, passed the Assessmen t Order . Therefore, the impugned order passed by 1st\nrespondent is liable to be set aside for want of authorization and jurisdiction.\n3. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial T axes-II filed the counter and opposed the writ petition.\n4. Heard Sri G.Narendra Chetty , learn ed counsel for petitioner , and learned Government Pleader for\nCommercial T axes-II representing the respondents.\n5. As can be seen, the Annexure to DRC-07 dated 13.12.2022 appended to the impugned Assessment Order\ndated 15.12.2022 shows that the Joint Commissioner (ST), Chittoor has issued authorization for inspection in\nGST INS-01 dated 29.10.2019 to the Deputy Commissioner (ST), Intelligence, Chittoor / 2nd respondent vide\nproceedings dated 29.10.2019 to inspec t the premises of the petitioner . However , the impugned Assessment\nOrder dated 15.12.2 022 was passed by the Deputy Commissioner (ST), Special Circle, Chittoor Division / 1st\nrespondent.\n6. Regarding the above discrepancy , learn ed Government Pleader in his counter submitted that the proposal of\nthe Chief Commissioner of State Tax was approved by the Government as per the A.P. Gazette notification\nNo.1071 dated 02.07 .2022 and notified the cadre strength of the officers and staff of the officers of the Chief\nCommissioner of State Tax and restructured the Divisions and Circles, in that view , the cadre strength of the\nDeputy Commissioner in the restructured divisions was reduced to one. Therefore, the proper officer forVIVEKassessment shall be 1st respondent and hence, the 1st respondent has passed the impugned Assessment Order .\nWe find the above explanation of the G.P as plausible one.\n7. It is further stated in the counter that the 1st respondent has given show cause notice (DRC 01), dated\n12.09.2022 calling upon the petitioner to offer their objections and same was served on the petitioner through\nRPAD on the same day and through e-mail on 13.09.2022. The petitioner has not responded to the show cause\nnotice. Then personal hearing dated 21.09.2022 was fixed and served to the petitioner providing seven days\ntime for production of records or documents. The petitioner sought for sixty days time. Thereafter a notice\ndated 29.09.2022 was issued to the petitioner providing opportunity of thirty days for production of relevant\nrecords. Later several notices were served and finally the petitioner replie d on 12.12.2022. The main\ncontention of the petitioner was that the bifurcation of AC and NON-AC ticke ts was not taken into account.\nHowever assessment was done on both AC and NON-AC buses and also data received for revenue from third\nparties i.e., M/s ABHI BUS and RED BUS. Basing on the record the tax and penalty were imposed U/s 74 of\nCGST/SGST Act, 2017. It is further argued that the data requested by the tax payer has been completely\nfurnished to him. Even after several notices the petitioner has not produced relevant records though petitioner\ncan easily obtain data of his services, he unnecessarily filed the writ petition.\n8. In the light of above counter averments reiterated in the argument of learned G.P the only aspect to be\nconsidered is whether the information obtained by the 1st respondent from the third parties i.e., Ms/ ABHI\nBUS and RED BUS is confined to the turnover of the petitioner relating to A.P. State or it includes the\nremaining three States also. The petitioner's grievance is that the respondent obtained total turnover basing on\nwhich the assessment was made which is wrong. Neither in the counter nor in arguments, that aspect has been\nclarified by the respondents. Therefore, we deem it apposite to give an opportunity to the petitioner to furnish\nthe relevant data showing the turnover of the petitioner relating to A.P, Tamilnadu, Telangana and Puducherry\nseparately for appreciation of the Authorities and to make fresh assessment in accordance with law .\n9. The Writ Petition  is allowed and the impugned Assessment Order dated 15.12.2022 passed by 1st\nrespondent under SGST /CGST Acts,  2017 for the tax periods 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 (up to\nNovember , 2019) is hereby set aside and liberty is given to the petitioner to submit the relevant records\nshowing the turnover relating to his bus business separately for the States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,\nTamilnadu and Puducherry for the relevant period before 1st respondent, on the condition of petitioner\ndepositing admitted tax less the tax already deposited within three (3) weeks from the date of receipt of copy\nof this order , in which case, the 1st respondent shall consider the same and after affording an opportunity of\nhearing to the petitio ner, pass fresh assessment order for the relevant period on merits and in accordance with\nthe governing law and rules expeditiously . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, pending if any , shall stand closed.\n*Partly in favour of assessee"}

The averments in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition show that the petitioner is a Private\nLimited Company engaged in manufacture of jams, fruit jellies etc., and registered under the Central Goods\nand Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, \"CGST Act\" and the Andhra Pradesh State Goods and Services Tax\nAct, 2017 (for short, \"the SGST Act\"). On verification of the GSTR-3B monthly  returns filed during  the year\n2018-19, respondent No. 1 found that some of the GSTR 3B returns were filed beyond the due dates  and thus,\nresulting in delayed payment of CGST/ SGST/IGST . Hence, respondent No. 1 demanded payment of interest\nand penalty of Rs. 1,92,892/- and Rs. 6,50,800/- respectively . For payment of the said amount, a show cause\nnotice was issued to the petitioner on 25-4-2019. Subsequently , an assessment order , dated  15-11-2019, came\nto be passed by respondent No. 1 confirming levy of interest of Rs. 1,92,892/- and a penalty of Rs. 6,86,944/-,\nwhich is higher than the penalty actually proposed in the show cause notice.\nThe averments in the affidavit further show that the said order was served on the petitioner physically on 25-\n11-2019 informing that an appeal  would lie under Rule 108(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules,\n2017 (for short, \"CGST Rules\"). An appeal  came to be filed by the petitione r vide Appeal  No.\n10/2020(T)GST which came to be rejec ted on 30-7-2021 on the ground that it was filed beyond the period of\nlimitation. Challenging the same, the present writ petition came to be filed.\n4. Sri P.Karthik Ram ana, learned counsel for the petitioner , would submit that in terms of rule 142(5) of\nCGST/SGST Rules, a summary of the order issued under section 73 shall be uploaded electronically in Form\nGST DRC-07 specifying therein the amount of tax, interest and penalty payable by the person chargeable with\ntax. According to him, the summary of the order was uploaded by the adjudica ting authority only on 18-11-\n2021 and as such, the period of limitatio n for filing an appeal  has to be reckoned from the said date. He took\nus through  relevant provisions in suppo rt of the same. In support of his plea, he also relied upon a judgment,\nGujarat State Petr onet Ltd.  v.

On the other hand,  Sri B.V.S.Chalapathi Rao, learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for respondent\nNos.1 and 2, opposed the same contend ing that the reason for rejection is not because of lack of material but\non the ground of limitation and as such, the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that no appeal\ncould be filed by the petitioner cannot be accepted. He, however , submits that in view of the orders passed by\nthe Hon'bl e Supreme Court extending the period of limitation due to pandemic, the discretion is always left to\nthe Court to pass appropriate orders.\n6.

Rule 108 of the CGST Rules reads as under:\u2014\n\"Rule 108. Appeal  to the Appellate Authority .\u2014(1) An appeal  to the Appellate Authority under sub-\nsection (1) of section 107 shall be filed in FORM GST APL-01, along with the relevant documents, either\nelectronically or otherwise as may be notified by the Commissioner , and a provisional acknowledgement\nshall be issued to the appellant immediately .\n(2) The grounds of appeal  and the form of verification as contained in FORM GST APL-01 shall be\nsigned in the manner specified in rule 26.\n(3) A certified copy of the decision or order appealed  against shall be submitted within seven days of\nfiling the appeal  under sub-rule (1) and a final acknowledgement, indicating appeal  number shall be\nissued thereafter in FORM GST APL 02 by the Appellate Authority or an officer authorised by him in\nthis behalf:\nProvided  that where the certified copy of the decision or order is submitted within seven days from the\ndate of filing the FORM GST APL-01, the date of filing of the appeal  shall be the date of the issue of the\nprovisional acknowledgement and where the said copy is submitted after seven days, the date of filing of\nthe appeal  shall be the date of the submission of such copy .\"\n8. A perusa l of above provisions would make it clear that the appeal  is required to be filed in an electronic\nmode only and if any other mode is prescribed, then, the same is required to be notified by way of a\nnotification. There is nothing on record to show that any notification was issued prescribing any other mode\nby which an appeal  could be filed. Therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the petition er that the\ntime period for filing appeal  would start only when the order is uploaded in GST portal cannot be brushe d\naside more so, in view of the Division Bench Judgment of the Gujarat High Court, which has been placed\nbefore this Court.\n9. Be that as it may, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, Cognizance for Extension of Limitation , In re [2022] 134\ntaxmann.com 307/4 41 ITR 722, extended the time period from 15-3-2020 to 28-2-2022 for the purpose of\ncomputing the period for filing the appeal . Since the order of respondent No. 1, dated  15-11-2019, was sent by\ne-mail to the petitioner on 25-11-2019, which was admitted by respondent No. 1 in Letter O.C.No.148 of\n2021, dated  2-3-2021 , three months ' time would expire on 24-2-2020 and another one month  from there\nwould be on 24-3-2020.\n10. Having regard to the above and taking into consideration the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nreferred to above, it can be, therefore, held that filing of appeal  by the petitioner on 3-12-2020 is within the\nperiod of limitation.\n11. Accordingly , the order , dated  30-7-2021, in Appeal  No. 10/2020(T)GST passed by respondent No. 2 is set\naside and the matter is remanded back to respondent No. 2 for adjudicating the dispute on merits in\naccordance with law .

Seetharama Murti, J. - This writ petition, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is filed seeking\nverbatim the following relief:\n'\u2026to issue an appropriate writ, order or direction in the nature of writ of mandamus directing the\nrespondents to open the GSTN portal and enable petitioner to file the TRAN-I and transfer the credit to\nGST or alternativel y, in the event that the respondents are not able to pen the GSTN portal, the\nrespondents may be directed to accept the GST TRAN-I manually and allow the credit and permit the\npetitioner to utilize the said credit for payment of GST tax and pass such further orders in the interests of\njustice.'\n2. We have heard the submissions of Sri C.V .Narasimham, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner; of\nlearned Assistant Solicitor General of India, appearing for the respondents 1 to 6; and, of the learned\nGovernment Pleade r for Commercial taxes appearing for the 7th respondent. We have perused the material\nrecord.\n3. The case of the writ petitioner is this:\nThe petitioner is engaged in the busines s of manufacture of FIBC Bags and Plastic Crates. The petitioner was\nregistered with Central Excise Departm ent prior to introduction of GST. On introduction of Goods and\nService Tax (GST), with effect from 01.07.2017, the petitioner had obtained registration under the new law\nand is assigned to the State jurisdiction for the purpose of assessment. In terms of transitional provisions of\nCGST Act, 2017, the unutilized credit of duty/tax as on 30.06.2017 can be transferred to GST as per the\nconditions prescribe d under various provisions of law. A form TRAN-I has been prescribed for availing the\ncredit. The Central Government extended the time limit for filing the form TRAN-I till 27.12.2017, vide\nOrder No.10/2017-GST , dated 15.11.2017. The petitioner is having closing balances of Cenvat Credit and\nVAT credit as on 30.06.2017. The petitioner tried to file the form TRAN-I through GST web portal, as\nprescribed under the Rules. Such attempts to file TRAN-I were made, on 25.12.2017, 26.12.2017 and\n27.12.2017. However , the system did not allow the petitioner to file the said return by not connecting to the\nGSTN or by indica ting that the 'due date is over', though the same was filed within the due date. The\npetitioner brought the said fact of inability in filing TRAN-I return to the notice of the 4th respondent, on\n11.04.2018, through GST web portal. The 5th respondent, through e-mail, dated  12.04.2018, suggested to the\npetitioner to approach the jurisdictional GST officers by stating that after examining the issue, the matter will\nbe forwarded to the GSTN and that on receipt of the grievance from the jurisdictional GST authorities, the\nGSTN authorities will resolve the issue. The petitioner addressed a letter , dated 12.04.2018, to the 1st\nrespondent informin g about the problem  being faced by the petitioner and its inability to file the return and\nrequested to resolve the issue and allow it to take credit amount in the GST credit ledgers. The petitioner also\nbrought to the notice of the 1st responde nt, the contents of the Circular no.39/13/2018-GST , dated 03.04.2018,\nvide their letter , dated 12.04.2018. However , no action has been taken by the 1st respondent to resolve the\nissue. For no fault of the petitioner and technical issues on web portal, which could not be resolved, an\namount of Rs.49,90,830/- is locked up causing financial strain to the petitioner . The petitioner addressed letter ,\ndated 17.09.2018, to the 4th respondent informing about their grievance with a request to resolve the issue, as\nthe grievance was not resolved by the jurisdictional GST authorities. Copy of the said letter , dated 17.09.2018,\nwas also marked to the respondents 1 and 3; but, no response was received from them. The 4th respondent\nvide letter , dated 05.10.2018, advised the petitioner to file the IT grievance through jurisdictional Field Officer\nor nodal officer of GST. The petitioner again addressed a letter , dated 16.10.2018 to the 1st respondent\nrequesting to resolve the issue. It was of no avail. The petitioner's personal visits to the office of the 1st & 2nd\nrespondents were also of no avail. The Government of India issued a Notification no.48/2018-Central Tax,\ndated 10.09.2018, wherein it was specified that GST Council had extended  the date for submitting the\ndeclaration electronically in Form GST TRAN-I upto 31.03.2019, on recomme ndation by the Council. Sincethe last date was fast approaching, the petitioner addressed a letter , dated 22.03.2019, to the 2nd respondent\nstating that no intim ation was received from the technical team and requested to sort out the problem and pass\nan order allowing the petitioner to take the credit. The said letter , dated 22.03.2019, was acknowledged by the\n2nd respondent, on 22.03.2019. In the background of the above facts & circumstances, and being aggrieved of\nthe inaction on the part of the respondents, the petitioner filed the present writ petition.\n4. Learned Governme nt Pleader representing the office of the learned Advocate General appearing for the\nrespondents would submit that the petitioner was lax and did not avail the extended time and that the\npetitioner is not entitled to the equitable relief.\n5. In the light of the facts and submission s, the only question that falls for consideration is as to whether the\npetitioner's request can be considered and, if so, whether the respondents can be directed to either open the\nportal to enable the petitioner to now file FORM GST TRAN-1 electronically or whether the petitioner can be\npermitted to submit manually , the typed Form GST TRAN-1 for acceptance by the respondents.\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner place d reliance on a decision of the Madras High Court in Tara Exports\nv. Union of India [2018] 98 taxmann.com 363 (Mad.)  in support of his contentions and contended that the\nMadras High Court, in the cited decision, referred to the judgments of various High Courts and noted that\nvarious High Courts granted reliefs to the petitioners in various proceedings before the High Courts under\nsimilar circumstanc es. He also placed reliance on a decision of this Court, dated 13.08.2019, passed in\nW.P.no.3298 of 2019.\n7. We have given earnest consideration to the facts and submissions.\n8. Having regard to the facts and the legal position obtaining, we are of the view that the issue involved in this\nwrit petitio n need not detain this Court for long. It is beneficial to refer to the decision of the High Court of\nDelhi in Uninav Developers (P .) Ltd.  v. Union of India  [2019-VIL-367-DEL] wherein the facts are as follows:\n\u2014\n\"On account of technical glitches, the petitioner therein was unable to claim CENV AT credit in Form\nTRAN-1; and, the petitioner could not file TRAN-1 electronically due to technical glitches of GST\nPortal; and, when the matter was placed  before ITGRC, it concluded that the present case falls under the\ncategory of B2, that is, 'Cases in which TRAN-1 filing attempted for the first time or revision was\nattempted but no error/no valid error reported.' Thus, in the absence of evidence , the re-filing of the form\nby the petitioner was not allowed. The petitioner therein contended that the petitioner was unable to\nconnect to the porta l to submit the return in the first place and that the portal reflected the message 'error\noccurred in submission'.\"\nIn the afore-stated decision, while dealing with an identical issue, the Delhi High Court referred to the\nprecedents and held as follows:\u2014\n\"As observed by this Court in several orders i.e., in Bhar gava Motors  v. Union of India [2019] 106\ntaxmann.com 200/74 GST 340 (Delhi) , Kusum Enterprises (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  [WP (C) No.\n7423/2019, dated 12-9-2019] and Sanko Gosei Technology India (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  [WP(C) 7335\nof 2019], the entire GST system is still in a trial and error phase and it will be too much of a burden to\nplace on the Assessee to expect them to comply with the requirement of the law where they are unable to\neven connect to the system on account of network failures or other failures.\"\nEventually , the Delhi High Court granted the relief to the petitioner therein.\nThis Court having noted the above decision of the Delhi High Court granted relief to the petitioner in\nW.P.no.3298 of 2019.\n9. In the light of the facts and the legal position obtaining, we are of the considered view that the petitioner's\nrequest merits consideration.\n10. Accordin gly, the Writ Petition is disposed of directing the respondents to eithe r open the Portal to enable\nthe petitioner to again file the Form GST TRAN-1 electronically or in the alternative accept the Form GST\nTRAN-1 presented manually , on or before 30.09.2019. It is needless to say that thereafter the petitioner's\nclaim shall be processed in accordance with law .\nNo order as to costs.S.K. JAINAs a sequel, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand dismissed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

He further submits that the respondent No. 2 Chief Commissioner of State Tax, Andhra Pradesh, has issued\nnecessary directions,  vide  CCST's e office File No. REV03-22021/7/2023-L1 SEC-CCT , dated 15-12-202 3, to\ncomply with the order in W.P.No.3010 9 of 2023. A copy of the same has been placed before us. In view\nthereof, filing of the af fidavit, by the Chief Commissioner , vide  order dated 5-1-2024, is dispensed with.\n9. It is apt to reproduce para Nos.5 to 9 of the judgment in W .P.No.30109 of 2023, as under:\n\"5. In M/s.SRK Enterprises'  case (cited  supra ), this Court referre d to the previous order of the Co-\nordinate Bench in the case of A.V.Bhanoji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) in W.P.No.2830 of 2023\ndecided on 14-2-2023 and held that the signatures cannot be dispensed with and the provisions of Section\n160 & 169 of the CGST Act, 2017 would not come to the rescue. This Court held that:\n\"7. On consideration of the submissions advanced and the legal provisions, we are of the view that\nSection 160 of CGST Act 2017 is not attracted. An unsigned order cannot be covered under \"any\nmistake, defect or omission therein\" as used in Section 160. The said expression refers to any mistake,\ndefect or omission in an order with respect to assessment, re assessment; adjudication etc and which shall\nnot be invalid or deemed to be invalid by such reason, if in substance and effect the assessment, re-\nassessment etc is in conformity with the requirements of the Act or any existi ng law. These would not\ncover omission to sign the order . Unsign ed order is no order in the eyes of law. Merely uploading of the\nunsigned order , may be by the Authority competent to pass the order , would, in our view , not cure the\ndefect which goes to the very root of the matter i.e. validity of the order .\n8. We are of the further view that Section 169 of CGST Act 2017 is also not attracted. Here, the question\nis of not signing the order and not of its service or mode of service.\n9. In the case of A. V. Bhanoji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) in W.P.No.2830 of 2023 decided on\n14-2-2023, upon which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the petitioner (Ex.P6), a Co-\nordinate Bench of this Court has held that the signatures cannot be dispensed with and the provisions of\nSections 160 and 169 of CGST Act would not come to the rescue.\n10.Paragraph 6 of A. V. Bhanoji Row  (supra ) is reproduced as under:-\n\"6. A reading of Section 160 of the Act makes it very much clear and candid that the safeguards\ncontained therein cannot be made applicable for the contingency in the present case. Section 169 of the\nAct, which deals with the service of notice, enables the department to make available any decision, order ,\nSummons, Notice or other communication in the common portal. In the guise of the same, the signatures\ncannot be dispensed with. In the considered opinion of this court, the aforesaid provisions of law would\nnot come to the rescue of the respondent herein, for justifying the impugned action.\"\n6. In view of the aforesaid, we allow this petition and set aside  the proceedings/order issued by\nrespondent No. 1 dated 25-9-2023. The respondent authorities to pass fresh orders in accordance with\nlaw, expeditiously .\n7. We observe that this is not the first case in which the order is not signed by the concerned authority but\nuploaded. The challenge to such kinds of order has been upheld. This defect and consequently passing\nfresh orders, delays the proceedings in tax matters. Also unnecessarily burdens this Court.SHREY A8. We therefore issue direction to the Chief Commissioner of the State Tax, Andhra Pradesh, to issue\nnecessary instructions/directions to all concerned to ensure that the orders should be signed manually or\ndigitally as the case may be and then to upload the same.\n9. The W rit Petition stands allowed in part in the aforesaid terms.\"\n10. Following the judgements of the Co-ordinate Bench, the impugned order is quashed only on the ground\nthat it has not been signed.\n11. The authority shall  pass fresh orders preferably within the period of four (04) weeks from the date of\nreceipt of a copy of this order , in accordance with law .\n12. We clarify that we have not entered into the merits of the impugned order , and have also not observed\nanything with respect to the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner  that the impugned order was\npassed on a ground dif ferent than as mentioned in the show cause notice.\n13. The writ petition stands allowed in part in the above terms.\nNo order as to costs.\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand dismissed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Suri Babu  for the Petitioner . Shreyas Reddy , Ld. Govt. Pleader for Commercial T ax for the Respondent.\nJUDGMENT\n \nRavi Nath Tilhari, J. - Heard Sri S. Suri Babu, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Shreyas Reddy ,\nlearned Government Pleader for the respondents.\n2. By means of this writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has\nchallenged the order dated 03.04.2023 for cancellation of the petitioner's registration of the GST, as also the\norder dated 16.06.20 23 by which the petitioner's application for revocation of the cancellation order was also\nrejected.\n3. Against the order of cancellation the remedy of appeal is also provided under the statute. However , we\nentertained the writ petition in view of the submission advanced on behalf of the petitioner that there was\nviolation of the principles of natural justice, inasmuch as the petitioner filed the reply dated 02.04.2023 to the\nshow cause notice dated 02.03.2023 issued to the petitioner but the same was not considered while passing the\nimpugned order dated 03.04.2023. A specific averment to that effect was made in Para 3 of the affidavit in\nsupport of the writ petition.\n4. The impugned order also mentioned that the petitioner filed the reply dated 02.04.2023 in the very first\nsentence, though in the later part it was mentioned that the reply was not filed.5. On 05.12.2023, the following order was passed:-\n\"The petitioner's GST registration was cancelled by an order dated 03.04.2023. Previously , show-cause\nnotice dated 02.03.2023 was issued stating the reasons for the proposed order .\n2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner filed reply on 02.04.2023 but the same\nhas not been considered while passing the order dated 03.04.2023.\n3. The order of cancellation in the first sentence mentioned about the reply dated 02.04.2023 but in next\nsentence it is mentioned that the petitioner did not file any reply .\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that an application for revocation of cancellation\nwas filed which has also been rejected vide order dated 16.06.2023.\n5. Learned Government Pleader shall obtain instructions with respect to the original order of cancellation\non the aspect as noted above.\n6. Post on 12.12.2023.\"\n6. On another date i.e. on 09.01.2024 based on the instructions, it was submitted by the learned Assistant\nGovernment Pleader that the petitioner did not file any reply against the show cause notice. On that date also,\nit was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner based on Para 3 of the affidavit in support of the writ\npetition that, the petitioner filed the reply dated 02.04.2023, but the same was not considered.\n7. As the impugned order in the later part said that the reply was not filed, the Court passed the order dated\n09.01.2024, inter alia, directing the learned Government Pleader to produce the original record.\n8. The petitioner was also directed to file additional affidavit bringing on record the copy of the petitioner's\nreply dated 02.04.2023 in support of the averment made in Para 3 of the affidavit, which was not annexed\nwith the writ petition.\n9. The order dated 09.01.2024 is reproduced as under:-\n\"The challenge in this petition is to the order of cancellation of the registration passed by respondent\nNo.1 in Form GST REG-19 vide Ref.No.ZA3704230022335 dated 03.04 .2023 of the petitioner mainly\non the ground that the petitioner's reply dated 02.04.2023 in respect to the show-cause notice dated\n02.03.2023 was not considered.\n2. In the order of cancellation, it is mentioned that no reply to the show cause notice was submitted\nthough in the first sentence the date of reply was mentioned as 02.04.2023.\n3. Sri A.V.Badra Naga Seshayya, learned Assistant Government Pleader appear ing for respondents based\non the written statement received from the Assistant Commissioner (ST) FAC, Nellore-II circle, submits\nthat the show cause notice was issued on 02.03.2023. Subsequently , opportunity for personal hearing was\ngiven to the petition er to appear on or before 30.03.2023 but the petitioner did not file any reply against\nthe show cause notice.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner filed reply dated 02.04.2023 and the\naverments to that ef fect is in para-3 of the af fidavit filed in support of this petition.\n5. From the aforesai d, we find that in para-3, the petitioner has specifically mentioned that he filed reply\ndated 02.04.2023. The impugned order also mentioned the petitioner's reply given on 02.04.2023. But, as\nper instruc tions, the petitioner did not file any reply . The petitioner has also not annexed any copy of his\nreply dated 02.04.2023 with the af fidavit.\n6. Let the original record be produced before this Court on the next date.\n7. Let the petitioner also file an addition al affidavit bringing on record copy of his reply dated 02.04.2023\nin support of the averment made in para-3 of the af fidavit.\n8. Post the matter on 14.02.2024.\"\n10. On 14.02.2024, two weeks further time was granted, as requested, to file additional af fidavit.\n11. On 13.03. 2024, the learned Governmen t Pleader produced the record and submitted that there was no\nreply of the petitioner said to be dated 02.04.2023, on record.12. The petitioner did not file copy of the said reply dated 02.04.2023 by additional  affidavit, inspite of many\nopportunities. The matter was however posted for 20.03.2024.\n13. The petitioner then, filed the additional af fidavit vide I.A.No.1 of 2024, dated 19.03.2024.\n14. The petitio ner has annexed P1 (at Page 9) of the additional affidavit the alleged reply which however does\nnot bear any date.\n15. Learned counsel for the petitioner today submits that the reply was not filed, and though the reply was\nprepared but it remained in the records of the petitioner and was not uploaded as well. He has referred to Para\n4 of the additional af fidavit.\n16. Para 4 of the additional af fidavit reads as under:-\n\"4. The petitioner submits that filing of the returns under the CGST , 2017, was being handled by Sri\nMahesh, Tax Practitioner . The petitione r was not aware of non-filing of the returns consecutively for a\nperiod of six months  from February , 2023. As there was no business operations  from the said month, the\npetitioner was also under the bonafied impression that no return need be filed and therefore the said issue\nhad not been taken note of. When the show cause notice proposing to cancel the Registration Certificate\nhad been issued, it was brought to the notice of the petitioner and a reply was drafted and was placed in\nthe file. A copy of the same is herewith enclosed as Annexure - P1. As all the notices and replies are to\nbe sent by mail and as the said reply was available in the file, the petitioner  was under the bonafied\nimpression that the said reply had been sent by mail. However , it was subsequently verified and noticed\nthat said reply had not either been sent physically or by mail. In view of the same, the petitioner hereby\nsubmits an uncondit ional apologies to this Hon'ble Court for the mis-statement and anomaly for making\nthe above submission in the Affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition. As the above said reply was\navailable in the file, the petitioner was under the bonafied impression that it has been drafted and filed.\nHence, the petitioner submits that the mistake is not intentional and the petitioner tender unconditional\napologies to this Hon'ble Court.\"\n17. Thus, the petitioner did not file the reply to the show cause notice. But, the writ petition was filed with an\naverment that the reply dated 02.04.2023 was filed and was not considered, and based thereon the plea of\nviolation of the principles of natural justice was raised to challenge the impugned order .\n18. Learned Government Pleader submits that so far as the mention of filing the reply dated 02.04.2023 by the\npetitioner in the impugned order is concerned, the same resulted because it is automatically generated by the\nsystem, in every order, on the expiry of the period granted to file reply , takin g the date of the show cause\nnotice and the period granted for filing the reply . He submits that the relevant is the later part in the order\nwhich mentioned that the reply was not filed.\n19. Be it as it may, as regards the submission of the learned Government Pleader , but we are not satisfied with\nthe oral explanation offered by learned Government Pleader . In the order there should be no contradictions i.e.\nto mention firstly that, the reply was filed and secondly that the reply was not filed. Either it is filed or it is not\nfiled. The order must reflect the true position regarding filing of the reply , whet her the reply was filed or was\nnot filed. Even if it is a case of auto generation, as submitted by Government Pleader , this aspect requires to\nbe looked into by the concerned authority , so that in future, any such inconsiste ncy in the order does not arise\nand the correct factual position finds mention and is so reflected in the order .\n20. The petitioner ought to have been diligent and careful in making pleadings while filing the writ petition.\nWhen only the draft was prepared which as submitted remained kept in the petitioner's record, the affidavit\nshould not have been filed to the effect that the reply was filed. The petitione r should have verified before\nfiling writ petition if the alleged draft reply was sent, through mail or otherwise or not.\n21. Though, we are not observing finally , but it appears to us prima facie,  that takin g the advantage of the\nmention in the impugned order that the reply was filed on 02.04.2023, the petitioner took the plea in his\naffidavit that the reply was filed. If the reply had been filed, a copy thereof should have been annexed with the\nwrit affidavit, which was not done. It is only after our order dated 09.01.2024 followed by few more orders\ndirecting the petitioner to file the additional affidavit brining on record copy of the reply , the additional\naffidavit was filed stating inter alia that the reply was not filed. Even with the additional affidavit, the alleged\ndraft reply which has been annexed, does not bear any date. W e cannot and must not condone such acts.ANURAG22. The petitioner has not approached this Court with clean hands. The petitioner has tried to abuse the\nprocess of the writ Court. He has unnec essarily engaged this Court in such a matter which deserved dismissal\non the first hearing, the petitioner having failed to file reply to the show cause notice and thus not having\navailed the opportunity of hearing granted, could not be heard complaining violation of the principles of\nnatural justice. He has encroached upon the public time on various dates, which could have been utilized in\nsome other cases.\n23. We dismiss the writ petition imposing a cost of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) on the\npetitioner .\n24. Let the costs be deposited with the Secretary , Andhra Pradesh High Court Legal Services Committee in\nthe High Court premises, Amaravati, within two weeks, failing which, the Registrar of this Court shall\nproceed to initiate the proceedings to recover the same, in accordance with law .\n25. We consid er it appropriate to direct the respondent No.2 to look into the aspect of the matter as in Paras 18\n& 19 (supra ) and to take appropriate necessary remedial steps to resolve such auto generation issue. If the\ncompetent authority to address such an issue is other than the respondent No.2, the same shall be brought to\nthe notice of such other authority by respondent No.2 along with copy of this order to do the needful. Such\nother authority is also directed hereby to do the needful.\n26. A copy of this order shall be sent to respondent No.2 for compliance.\n27. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

Learned counsel for the petitioner having drawn the attention of the Court to the said provisions\naforementioned would contend as follows: 'As per the said Rule, an appeal to the appellate authority underS.K. JAINsub section (1) of section 107 shall be filed in the required form, along with the relevant documents either\nelectronically or otherwise and hence, the petitioner is entitled to file the appeal either electronically or\notherwise and that in the case on hand unless the order , which is being sought to be impugned is uploaded in\nthe web portal, it is not possible to prefer an appeal electronically and that in the instant case the said\nrequirement of uploading the order is not fulfilled. In the light of the rule position obtaining, the appellate\nauthority ought to have entertained the appeal or in the alternative ought to have given an opportunity to the\nappellate/petitioner to comply with the provisions aforementioned instead of rejecting the appeal by the\nimpugned order .'\n3. Learned Standing Counsel for the respondents would submit that no notification as envisaged under Rule\n108 aforementioned  was issued by the Commissioner . However , he would point out from the impugned order\nthat it was noticed in the said order that the appeal is not filed electronically through G.S.T W eb Portal in form\nGST APL-01, even after ample opportunity was given to the petitioner .\n4. Havi ng regard to the facts and submissi ons and as the case of the petitioner requires adjudication on merits\nand when substantial justice is pitted against technical considerations, it is always necessary to prefer the ends\nof justice,  we are of the considered view that the request of the petitioner merits consideration. Such course\nalso would help the petitioner in having his cause decided on merits.\n5. In the result, the writ petition is allowed  and the impugned rejection order is set aside with a direction to the\n2nd respondent to entertain the appeal of the petitioner and pass appropriate orders, in accordance with the\nprocedure established by law , however , after giving an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner .\nNo order as to costs.\n6.

While W .P.No.1832 of 2022 is filed by the same party seeking the following relief:\"\u2026 to issue an appropriate writ order or direction more particularly a writ in the nature of WRIT OF\nMANDAMUS, declaring the action of the 5th Respondent in issuing impugned notice under section\n79(1)( d) of CGS/APGST Act 2017 proposing to conduct Auction of the Petitioner's premises, Door No\n16-7-14, a residential house with 58.66 sq yrds on 10-1-2022 to recover Rs. 37,34,52,454/ under CGST\nand SGST  as illegal, arbitrary , unjustified and set aside the same, conseq uentially direct the 6th\nrespondent to conduct investigation with the assistance of 3 to 5 Respondents into the allegations made in\nDemand Notice No. RC No: JA 3/42/2020 dated 21-1-2021 with the Petitioner's cooperation and to pass\nsuch..\u2026\"\n4. On 9-7-2020, the 1st respondent issued a show cause notice proposing to assess Sri Konathala Lakshmana\nChakravarthy under Andhra Pradesh Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 (for short 'the Act') for the period from\n1-7-2017 to 15-2-2020 on the following turnovers construing that the entire business was done by the\npetitioner .\n\"1. Purchase value of iron & steel scrap\nLiable to be taxed on reverse char ge Rs. 165,97,88,686 @ 18% Rs. 29,87,61,963\n2.

Pursuant to the said show cause notice, the petitioner herein submitted his explanation, which lead to\npassing of the order on 21-1-2021 impugned herein.\n6. Sri S.Dwarakanath Reddy , learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petition er mainly submits that the\nimpugned proceedings came to be issued without furnishing the material relied upon by the authority\nconcerned while directing the petitioner to pay tax of Rs. 37,34,52,454/-. In other words, the learned counsel\nwould contend that even as per section  75(7) of the Act, the petitioner should be given material relied upon by\nthe authority , while passing an order against him. As the order came to be passed without furnishing the\nmaterial relied upon, the same would be in violation of principles of natural justice.\n7. Sri T.C.D .Sekhar , learned Governme nt Pleader for Commercial Tax, strenuously opposed the same\ncontending that the petitioner has committed fraud and claimed input tax credit without movement of the\nvehicle through the check post. He further submits that since the material collected and relied upon by the\nauthority was from the Toll Plaza, no prejudice is caused to the petitioner since  the very same material could\nhave been collected by the petitioner as well as from the T oll Plaza.\n8. A perusa l of the material on record would show that the authority relied upon Exs.P1 and P2, which are\nrunning into 800 pages. The fact that the said material was relied upon by the Assistant Commissioner(4th\nrespondent) is not in dispute. The fact that the said material was relied upon is evident from the findings given\nto objections 3 and 4. It is appropriate to extract the same, which is as under:\nObjection No. 3:\nIt was contended that out of 34 registrations 10 registrations belongs to the State of Telangana which\nwere outsi de the jurisdiction of the officers of State of Andhra Pradesh and accordingly their turnovers\ncannot be taxed by State of Andhra Pradesh.\nFinding:\nFirst of all, it is necessary to understand that for the entire scheme of operations the taxable person is the\nking pin. The scrap which was purportedly sold by him to Telangana did not reach the destined place as\nverified from Vempadu Toll Plaza data which is on way to Telangana where every vehicle moving out of\nVisakhapatnam or coming into Visakha panam must get checked. Further even the incoming vehicles as\nper the documents of the perpetrators in the operations never came into State of Andhra Pradesh. Again it\nis evident from the records of Toll Plaza  which are enclosed as Exhibit No. 1. It is interesting to note that\nthe vehicles either have not crossed the toll gate or the vehicles which have crossed have come from\nTelangana to Toll Plaza with a speed of modern racing car. In some occasions , the vehicle has crossed\nprior to the time of e-way bill generation and some times (in very few occasions) in extra ordinary delay .To the extent of vehicles, checked, it is quite obvious that the taxable person randomly chose the number\nof vehicles going to Telangana and created a record based on their registration number . It is possible that\nthe scrap has been disposed off locally but efforts were made to show that they were consigned to\nTelangana. In fact the taxable person himself has conceded in his written statement that they supplied\nscrap iron to M/s. S.P.Bailing Press with registered Number 37ABTPS0369 NIZO of Visakhapatnam.\nHence it can be easily inferred that in all the different registrations floated, only documents were created\nto camouflage the real transactions.\nObjections No. 4:\nIt is argued that the creation of the Registrations which was attributed to the taxable person was in fact\nfiling the returns regularly and therefore cannot be said to be bogus. Further on some occasions when the\nvehicles were detained by the authoritie s, who have collected tax and penalty from the respective taxable\npersons, released the vehicles. It is shown that the taxable person has no involvement in the transactions\nmade in the other registrations.\nFinding:\nIt is true that in some cases returns were filed. Returns were filed but they have closed the business in a\nvery short time. For example M/s. SKML Enterprises, M/s. Venkatasai Trader s, M/s. Sri Veeranjaneya\nTraders, M/s .Bhavani traders, M/s.Koti Enterprises, M/s.Sri Durga Enterprises, M/s.Sekhar Traders,\nM/s.Sridevi Enterpri ses, M/s. Surya Traders, M/s. Bhagavan Traders, M/s.Sri Durgadevi Traders, M/s Sri\nRama Enterprises, M/s. Viswa Traders, M/s. Sri Sakti Enterprises, M/s. Bojanki Enterprises, M/s. Ranga\nEnterprises, M/s. Srinivasa Enterprises (Exhibit No. 2) and in other cases, the registrations are lying. It is\nquite interesting to see that the input tax has been nullified by the sham transactions from State of\nTelangana back to the same taxable person. In such case no tax are infinitesima l quantum has to be paid\ncompared to the profit made in the illegal trade. One can continue such Registrations eternally . Therefore,\nthe claim of the taxable person that returns are being filed in all cases and taxes are being paid is\nincorrect. Further , the taxable person has contended that the detained vehicles were released by the holder\nof respective registrations each in itself is the evidence of essence. It is surpris ing as to why the taxable\nperson came to know about each vehicle which were detained and who have released those vehicles. The\ntaxable person may produce evidence if any that in all such cases where the registration holders have\nthemselves come forward and released the goods.\n9. Section  75(7) of the Act reads as under:\n\" The amount of tax, interest and penalty demanded in the order shall not be in excess of the amount\nspecified in the notice and no demand shall be confirmed on the grounds other than the grounds specified\nin the notice.\"\n10. In BGR Ener gy Systems Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner , Commer cial Taxes, Large Tax Payer Unit [2009]\n49 APSTJ 213, the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in paragraph Nos.8 and 9 observed as under:\n\"A person should not be deprived of his vested right, or be made to suffer any disadvantage or detriment,\nwithout telling him why such an action was warranted and without giving him an opportunity to say why\nit should not be taken. The requirement of audi alteram partem has two element s-notice of what action is\nproposed, why it is proposed, and adequate opportunity to show that the action is uncalled for. A\ncorollary of the audi alteram partem rule, namely \"qui aliquid statuerit, parte inaudita altera acquum licet\ndixerit, haud acquum fecerit\" is that \"he who shall decide anything without the other side having been\nheard, although he may have said what is right, will not have done what is right\" or in other words, as is\nnow expre ssed, \"justice should not only be done but should manifestly be seen to be done\". The notice\nmust be precise and unambiguous. It should apprise the party determinatively of the case he has to meet.\n(Canara Bank  v. Debasis Das MANU/SC/0225/2003:2003) IILLJ 531SC; Canara Bank  v. V.K.Awasthy\nMANU/SC/0249/2005: (2005)IILLJ461 SC). The person proceeded against must know that he is required\nto meet the allegati ons which might lead to a certain action being taken against him. (S.L. Kapoor  v.\nJagmohan MANU/SC0036/1980: [1981]1SCR 746). A proper hearing must always include a 'fair\nopportunity to those who are parties to the controversy for correcting or contradicting anything\nprejudicial to their view'. (4) A crucial aspect of a fair hearing is having a right to know the grounds or\nthe opposing case in advance.(5)TARUNIf prejudicial allegations are made against a person he must, normally , be given particulars of them. He\nmust also be enabled to controvert, correct or comment on other evidence or information that may be\nrelevant to the decision. (6) It is essential to state the particulars to enable the person to answer the case\nagainst him. A notice which does not mention the particulars, on which the case against the person is\nbased, cannot provide a foundation for the proceedings that follow .(Nasir Ahmad  v. Asstt.Custodian\nGeneral, Evacuee Property ) MANU/SC/0377/1980: [1980]3SCR 248. The show cause notice which\npreceded the impugned assessment order make no mention of the grounds or the basis on which the\nturnover of Rs. 815.52 crores, among others, is proposed to be taxed under the A.P.VAT Act. The\npetitioner -assessee has, thereby , been denied the opportunity of effectively showing cause why such\nturnover is not liable to tax under the A.P.VAT Act. The show cause notices, in the present case, violate\nthe audi alteram partem rule.\"\n11. From the judgment  of the Division Bench referred to above, it is very clear that a person proceeding must\nknow that he is required to meet the allegations, which may lead to certain action being taken against him.\nApart from that the Bench also held that an opportunity must be given to enable to controvert correct or\ncomment on the evidence or informati on that may be relevant to the decision. A notice which does not\nmention the particul ars, on which the case against the person is based, cannot  provide a foundation for the\nproceedings that follow . As the order impugned herein refers to Exs.P1 and P2, which were never supplied to\nthe petitio ner at any point of time, it can be said without hesitation that the same will be in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice. It may be true that the petitioner has committed a grave offence but any order\npassed without providing an opportunity to defend his case would be in violation of the procedure established\nby law .\n12. Accordingly , the writ petitions are allowed and the orders impugned are set aside and the matters are\nremanded back to the 4th respondent to deal with the same afresh after furnishin g the material relied upon and\nafter giving an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner . No costs.\n13. All pending miscellaneous petitions if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Heard learned counsel for the petitioner Sri Bhaskar Reddy Vemireddy and learned Government Pleader for\nCommercial T axes-II.\n3. The grievance of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that both the impugned  show cause notice dated 1-\n10-2022 and the order for cancellation of registration dated 20-10-2022 could not able to show any violation\ninasmuch as, they themselves are precast to that effect as in the show cause notice it has been mentioned \"in\ncase the registration has been obtained by means of fraud, willful misstatement or suppression of facts\" andSHREY Aequally in the cancellation order , it has been mentioned \"On verification of GSTR 1 v. GSTR 3B returns and\nsales turnover , it is observed that, within a span of five months, the TRP has made purchase and sale of scrap\nworth of Rs.9.63 Crores for which he has not submitted clear records. Hence the transactions appear to be\nsuspicious and hence registration is hereby cancelled (emphasis supplied)\".\n4. Learned counsel would submit that in the show cause notice as well as the impugned cancellation order do\nnot divulge any of the mistake or fraud or misdeed committed by the petitio ner in the due course of his\nbusiness and therefore both show cause notice and order for cancellation of registration are not sustainable in\nthe eye of law. Learned counsel would submit that in similar circumstances in S.B. Traders  v.

Besid es, directing the Principal Commissioner of Central Tax, Hyderabad\nCommissionerate, to look into the conduct and functioning of the 1st respondent therein and to take remedial\nsteps.\n5. We have gone through the impugned show cause notice and order for cancellation of registration and found\nforce in the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner , for, both show the cause notice as well as the\norder of cancellation of registration are dubious enough and failing to divulge the misdeed or fraud allegedly\ncommitted by the petitioner . While the show cause notice says that in case the petitio ner has committed any\nfraud, willful misstatement or suppression of facts, the order of cancellation of registration says that he has not\nsubmitted clear records. Both of them are not clear enough to understand the mind of the issuing authority .\nTherefore, we have no occasion to hold that both impugned show cause notice as well as the order for\ncancellation of registration are not sustainable in the eye of law. In similar circumstances, Hon'ble High Court\nof Telangana has set aside the impugned order of cancellation of the GST registration of the petitioner therein.\n6.

Kumar , Learned Counsel for the petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - Heard Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar , learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned\nGovernment Pleader for Commercial T ax-II.\n2. The griev ance of the petitioners in all the batch of Writ Petitions is common as ventilated by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners. The Writ Petitioners intended to prefer appeals against the Assessment Orders\npassed in the above batch of Writ Petitions and when they intended to make pre-deposit of 10% of the\ndemanded tax as a condition precedent for preferring the appeal through the official Web Portal under Form\nAPL-01 on 19-11-2022, due to some technical glitche, the Web Portal did not permit them to make the\npayment and therefore, the petitioners made the payment through Form DRC-03 on 19-11-2022 and the sameRITAwas accepted by the Web Portal. The learned counsel would submit that however their appeals were rejected\non the main ground that the petitioners have made the pre-deposit through Form  GST DRC-03 instead of the\nprescribed Form APL-01 and the said authority has no power to consider such payments made in the Form\nGST DRC-03 as 10% pre-deposit for registering the appeals. He would further submits that it is only because\nof the technical glitch that was occur red on 19-11-2022, the petitioners could not make the pre-deposit\nthrough the prescribed Format APL-01 and had to pay through Form GST DRC 03 and therefore, the said act\nof the petitioners may not be treated as a willful one.\n3. Learned counsel would further submit that since in the process delay  was occurred, the petitioners have\nfiled separate applications to condone  delay , but the Respondent No. 2 in the impugned  Orders have not\nmentioned about the delay  condoning  petitions and without considering the reasons for delay , simply rejected\nthe appeals on the ground that the pre-deposit of 10% was made through a wrong format i.e., Form GST\nDRC-03. The learne d counsel thus requested the Court to direct the respondent No. 2 to consider the reasons\nsubmitted by the petitioners for the delay  in filing the appeal s in the right perspective and pass appropriate\norders.\n4. Learned Governme nt Pleader opposed the petitions stating that when the Act prescribed Form APL-01 to\nmake the pre-deposit, the petitioners could not have chosen another format, which is a violation of the\nprocedure, and therefore, the respondent No. 2 had rightly rejected the appeals.\n5. On perus al of the material filed along with the Writ Petitions, the petitioners have filed the copies of the\ndelay  condoning  petitions submitted to the Respondent No. 2. Thus, we find force in the submission of the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners have filed delay  condoning  petitions before the\nrespondent No. 2. However , in the impugned  Orders, nothing is mentioned about the filing of the delay\ncondoning  petitions and the non satisfaction over the reasons submitted for such delay . Be that as it may, as\nrightly submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners, the appeals were rejected on the main ground that\nthe pre-deposit was made through wrong format i.e.,Form GST DRC-03 instead of Form APL-01.\n6. In this regard, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that due to technical glitch, they\nhad to make the pre-deposit through Form GST DRC-03 instead of APL-01 and it is not a willful act. Whether\nthe petitioners were forced to make payment of pre-deposit through Form GST DRC-03 instead of APL-01 is\na question of fact, which has to be considered in the light of other surrounding facts. In our considered view ,\nthe respondent No. 2 is the proper authority to consider the above factual aspects and to decide the fate of\ndelay  condoning  petitions in right perspective. Therefore, the impugned  Rejection Orders are  set aside  and the\nmatters are remanded back to the respondent No. 2 with a direction to consider the reasons in the delay\ncondoning  petitions submitted by the petitioners and after affording an opportunity of hearing to them pass\nany appropriate orders in accordance with governing law and rules expeditiously .\n7. Since it is submitted that pursuant to the rejection of appeals, the respondent No. 3 has attached the bank\naccount of the petitioners for enforcement of the assessment orders, and pleaded urgency in the matters, we\ndirect the petitioners to appear before the Respondent No. 2 on 8-2-2024 and the respondent No. 2 shall take\nup the matters on that day .\n8. Accordingly , all the W rit Petitions are disposed of. No costs.\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any , pending shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Learned Assistant Government Pleade r for Commercial Tax has obtained written instructions from the\nauthority and informed that the impugned order is not signed but was uploaded by the competent authority . He\nraised the same plea as was raised in M/s.SRK Enterprises' case (cited supra) relying on Section 160 and 169\nof the Central Goods and Services T ax Act, 2017 (for short 'the CGST Act, 2017').5. In M/s.SRK Enterprises' case (cited supra), this Court referred to the previous order of the Co-ordinate\nBench in the case of A.V.Bhanoji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) in W.P.No.2830 of 2023 decided on\n14.02.2023 and held that the signatures cannot be dispensed with and the provisions of Section 160 & 169 of\nthe CGST Act, 2017 would not come to the rescue. This Court held that:\n\"7. On consideration of the submissions advanced and the legal provisions, we are of the view that\nSection 160 of CGST Act 2017 is not attracted. An unsigned order cannot be covered under \"any\nmistake, defect or omission therein\" as used in Section 160. The said expression refers to any mistake,\ndefect or omission in an order with respe ct to assessment, re-assessment; adjudication etc and which shall\nnot be invalid or deemed to be invalid by such reason, if in substance and effect the assessment, re-\nassessment etc is in conformity with the requirements of the Act or any existi ng law. These would not\ncover omission to sign the order . Unsign ed order is no order in the eyes of law. Merely uploading of the\nunsigned order , may be by the Authority competent to pass the order , would, in our view , not cure the\ndefect which goes to the very root of the matter i.e. validity of the order .\n8. We are of the further view that Section 169 of CGST Act 2017 is also not attracted. Here, the question\nis of not signing the order and not of its service or mode of service.\n9. In the case of A. V. Bhanoji Row v. Assistant Commissioner (ST) in W.P.No.2830 of 2023 decided on\n14.02.2023, upon which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the petitioner (Ex.P6), a Co-\nordinate Bench of this Court has held that the signatures cannot be dispensed with and the provisions of\nSections 160 and 169 of CGST Act would not come to the rescue.\n10. Paragraph 6 of A. V . Bhanoji Row ( supra ) is reproduced as under:-\n\"6. A reading of Section 160 of the Act makes it very much clear and candid that the safeguards\ncontained therein cannot be made applicable for the contingency in the present case. Section 169 of\nthe Act, which deals with the service of notice, enables the department to make available any\ndecision, order , Summons, Notice or other communication in the common portal.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that respondent No. 4 has cancelled the GST registration and\nfurther respondent No. 5 has also rejected the petitioner's application for revoca tion of cancellation  vide order\nRef.No.ZA3710230041449, dated 4-10-2023.\n4. The petitioner was issued a show-cause  notice dated 26-6-2023. The order of cancellation was passed on 7-\n7-2023, mentioning that the petitioner did not submit a reply to the show-cause notice.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner submitted a reply on 7-7-2023 itself, i.e., date\nof the order of cancellation. He however submits that the reply was not filed within the time granted in the\nshow cause notice.\n6. For revoc ation of order dated 7-7-2023, the petitioner filed an application, upon which the notice dated 4-8-\n2023 was issued, mentioning that the application for revocation was liable to be rejected for the reasons\ndisclosed that \"according to the field visit report there is no business running in the mentioned address\".\n7. The petitioner submitted a reply dated 4-9-2023, interalia submitting that the petitioner is doing business at\nthe registe red address and due to change of mobile number given at the time of registration which was not\nworking, the communication could not be made. It is further submitted that there are photographs to show that\nthe business is being run at the registered address.\n8. The application for revocation has been rejected by an order dated 4-10-2023, after examining the\npetitioner's reply on the ground that according to the field visit report there was no business running in the\nmentioned registered address.\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is running business at the registered address\nbut the petitioner's reply was not considered in proper perspective.\n10. Objection is raised by learned Government Pleader for the respondents that the petitioner has got the\nstatutory remedy to file appeal under the Goods and Services T ax Acts (for short 'GST Act').\n11. He subm its that the physical verification/field visit was made on 26-6-2023 and as per the field visit\nreport, there was no business running in the mentioned address. Subsequently , based on the said report, after\naffording opportuni ty of hearing to the petitioner , the order of cancellation of the GST registration and\nthereafter the order rejecting the application for revocation was passed by Deputy Assistant Commissioner .\n12. The fact of physica l verification finds mention in para-3 of the petitioner's affidavit in support of the writ\npetition in which it is interalia submitted that \"the petitioner sent an explanation in writing on 6-7-2023,\nexplaining that on 26-6-2023, he received a call from a person introducing himself as officer authorized for\nphysical verification of business and existence of the taxpayer , but the petitioner was out of station at that time\nand no one was there at the place of business and consequently no one can be present at the time of\ninspection\".\n13. Further , the petitioner in his application for revocation interalia mentioned as follows:-\n\"I entered into business and also other construction related sales with the help of siblings. Due to lack of\nspace for storing stock, I am conductin g business on consignment basis and sometime on commission\nbasis. On the basis of availability and demand, we provide contract services also\".\nIn the said application, the petitioner further submitted as follows:\n\"I accept that there was a procedure mistake on the part of me for not update the changing of my basic\nstructure. If I found so I will take the responsibility of paying all the GST dues without fail.\"\n14. The question if the petitioner was carry ing on his business at the registered address or not at the relevant\npoint of time, is a question of fact. The finding recorded in the order of cancellation of GST registration and in\nthe order rejecting the application for revocation, that the petitioner was not running business at the registered\naddress is a finding of fact, which prima facie  is based on some material in the form of the field inspection\nreport.KEV AL15. If the petitioner's case is contrary , that the business was being run at the registered address and if the\npetitioner has evidence to prove that, as submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner , the appropriate\nforum to reappraise the evidence to determine finding of fact, is not in the writ petition under Article 226 of\nthe Constitution of India.\n16. Undisputedly , the petitioner has got the statutory alternative remedy of appeal. If the petitioner so chooses\nor advised, the remedy of appeal may be availed as per the law .\n17. We are not inclined to entertain the writ petition.\n18. The W rit Petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

W ith their consent, this W rit Petition is disposed of at the stage of admission.\n2. The present Writ Petition came to be filed under article 226 of the Consti tution of India seeking the\nfollowing relief :-\n\"\u2026\u2026 to issue an appropriate writ or order or direction more particularly one in the nature of Writ of\nMandamus\n(i) declaring  the action of the 2nd respond ent in provisionally attaching the petitio ner's properties through\nthe impug ned proce edings in Form GST DRC 22 dated 7-5-2022 as illegal , arbitrary , high handed,\nwithout authority of law and jurisdiction and contrary to the provisions of the Act,\n(ii) declare that the impugned order passed by the 1st respondent in Form DRC-07 dated 20-6-2022 as\nillegal, arbitrary , high handed, without authority of law and jurisdiction, contrar y to the provisions of the\nCGST/SGST Act, 2017 and in violation of principles of natural justice and set aside the same and pass\n\u2026\u2026\"3. As seen from the record, the petitioner has been regularly filing returns and paying resultant tax in terms of\nSection 16 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017/the State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. It is\nsubmitted that respondent No. 1, in pursuance of inspection conducted in the business premises of the\npetitioner , issued notice in GST DRC-01A, dated 31-1-2022, ascertaining an amount of Rs. 11,15,41,133/-\ntowards the tax paya ble by the petitioner . Detailed objections came to be filed requesting respondent No. 1 to\ndrop the proposed action. Instead of considering the objections and the elaborate documentary evidence filed\nby the petitioner , respondent No. 1 issued notice in GST DRC-01, dated 7-4-2022, demanding an amount of\nRs. 22,58,49,854/-, which includes 100% penalty and interest under section 50 of CGST/SGST Act. The\npetitioner once again submitted his explanation to the said notice along with the material. However , revised\nnotice in GST DRC-01, dated 30-5- 2022, came to be issued by respondent No. 1 demanding Rs.\n28,00,20,392/-.\nA reading of the order indicates that the said figures have been arrived at by respondent No. 1, mainly on the\nground that the petitioner failed to produce original tax invoices for the entire turnover but instead placed on\nrecord xerox copies of invoices for part of the turnover . It was further held that some of the dealers, from\nwhom the petitioner has purchased the goods, are not existing/fictitious. Enquiries with the toll gate\nauthorities revealed that some of the vehicles did not pass through the said toll gates at Chittoor . It was also\nheld that some of the owners of the vehicles, denied hiring of the vehicles to the petitioner for transport of the\ngoods and information in respect of some of the vehicles is not available on the transport website.\nIt is also submitted that in response to the revised notice in GST DRC-01 dated 30-5-2022, the petitioner filed\na letter dated 10-6-2 022 seeking 15 days' time to file objections explaining the circumstances as to why he\nneeds some time to file reply . Though the said letter was said to have been acknowledged by respondent No.\n1, there was no response from him eithe r rejecting or restricting the time sought for by the petitioner . But the\nimpugned order in Form GST DRC-07, dated 20-6-2022, came to be passed stating that the petitioner herein\ndid not respond to the revised notice issued in GST DRC-01, dated 30-5-2022.\nIt is also to be noted here that respondent No. 2 provisionally attached the bank account of the petitioner under\nsection 83 of the A.P .GST Act  vide order , dated 7-5-2022.\nChallenging the same, the present writ petition is filed.\n4. Reiterating the averments in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition, Sri Bhaskar Reddy\nVemireddy , learned counsel for the petitioner , would contend that the order of assessment is bad in law, as the\nmaterial relied upon by the assessing authority was not furnished to the petitioner , which disabled him from\ngiving appropriate reply to the show cause notice. He further submits that the provisional attachment order\nissued under section 83 of the APGST Act is also bad in law for the reason that the Joint Commissioner has\nno power to issue the same coupled with the fact that the authority did not record his explanation before\nissuing the provisional attachment order .\n5. Sri Y.N.V ivekanand a, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax appearing for respondent Nos.1 to\n4, on instructions, opposes the same. He would submit that the argument of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the Joint Commissioner could not have issued provisional attachment order under section 83 of\nthe APGST Act may not be correct. Insofar as the assessment order is concerned, according to him, the same\ncame to be passed basing on the materia l available with the assessing authority and as such, the Court cannot\nfind fault with it.\n6. A perusal of the revised notice issued  in GST DRC-01, dated 30-5-2022, would show that the authority\nrelied upon the material, which was not furnished to the petitioner . The assessment order does not indicate the\ndealers, whom the assessing authority claimed to have been examined to show that the petitioner has\npurchased goods from the dealers who are non-existing/fictitious. Further , the names of the toll gates through\nwhich these vehicles, according to the assessing authority , did not pass, and also the names of the owners of\nthe vehicle s, who have not hired their vehicles to the petitioner , are not furnished. Since this material forms\npart of the impugne d order , we are of the view that the assessing authority ought to have furnished the said\nmaterial enabling the petitioner to make a representation or produce any material contra to the same, to\nsubstantiate his plea. Non-furnishing of the same, in our view , would be violation of principles of natural\njustice.\n7. Ergo, the impugned  order passed by respondent No. 1 in Form DRC-07, dated  20-6-2022, is set aside and\nthe matter is remanded back to the asses sing authority . It is made clear that the petitioner herein shall make an\napplication within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order , requesting the authority toGKfurnish documents which are relied upon by him in passing the impugned order , in which event, the authority\nshall do the needful within a period of ten (10) days thereafter . Further , the assessing authority shall take into\nconsideration the additional objections, if any, to be raised by the petitioner and pass order in accordance with\nlaw, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner .\n8. Consequently , the provisional attachment order passed by respondent No. 2 in Form GST DRC-22, dated 7-\n5-2022, is set aside, giving liberty to the authority to issue fresh provisional attachment order , if required.\nInsofar as issuance of fresh provisional attachment order is concerned, the authority shall follow the procedure\ncontemplated under section 83 of the A.P .GST Act, 2017.\n9. Accordingly , this Writ Petition is allowed and the matter is remanded back to respondent No. 1/assessing\nauthority . There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition shall stand closed.\n* Partly in favour of assessee."}

Heard Sri B.Satish Sundhar , Senior Counsel, representing Sri Anup Koush ik Karavadi, counsel for\npetitioner; and Mrs. Santhi Chandra, Junior Standing Counsel for CBIC, appearing for the respondents.\n2. A prelimi nary objection has been raised by the Junior Standing Counsel that the impugned order is\nappealable under statute and in view of statutory alternative remedy of appeal the writ petition deserves not to\nbe entertained.\n3. Learned counsel for petitioner does not dispute the remedy of appeal but he submits that the writ petition is\nentertainable as the impugned order dt. 16.04.2024 is passed without jurisdiction by the AssistantRITA ROYCommissioner , CGS T, Anantapur Division holding that there was transfer of ownership of business by M/s.\nVenkatasai Ispat Industries Pvt. Ltd. In favour of petitioner . He submits that the petitioner has purchased, vide\nSale Deed  dt. 17.02.2021, plant & mach inery , land and building etc. but not the business. So the finding that\nthere was transfer of ownership of business within meaning of section 85 of the Central Goods and Services\nTax Act, 2017 (for short, 'the CGST Act') is not correct. Section 85 of the CGST Act was not applicable.\n4. We have considered the submissions advanced by learned counsels for the parties.\n5. Section 85 of the CGST Act as under:\n\"85. Liability in case of transfer of business.\u2014 (1) Where a taxable person, liable to pay tax under this\nAct, transfers his business in whole or in part, by sale, gift, lease, leave and license, hire or in any other\nmanner whatsoever , the taxable person and the person to whom the business is so transferred shall,\njointly and severally , be liable wholly or to the extent of such transfer , to pay the tax, interest or any\npenalty due from the taxable person upto the time of such transfer , whether such tax, interest or penalty\nhas been determined before such transfer , but has remained unpaid or is determined thereafter .\"\n6. Section 85(1) of the CGST Act uses the expression 'transfers his business' .\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance in the case of State of Karnataka  v. Shreyas Papers (P)\nLtd. (2006) 1 SCC 615/2006 taxmann.com 1848 (SC) . The Hon'ble Apex Court in the conte xt of Section\n29(2) of the State Financial Corporation s Act, 1951 (SFC Act) and Section 15(1) of the Karnataka Sales Tax\nAct, 1957, (KST Act), held that the transfer of \"ownership of business\" required that the business be sold as a\ngoing concern. It was observed that the mere transfer of one or more species of assets did not necessarily\nbring about the transfer of the \"ownership of business\" which was much wider than mere ownership of\ndiscrete or individual assets. It was held that Section 15(1) of the KST Act would apply when there is\ncomplete transfer of ownership of business so as to render the transferee as a successor -in-interest of the\ntransferor .\n8. In Krishna Lifestyle Technologies Ltd. v. Union of India  2008  SCC Online Bom 137/[2010] 25 STT 148\n(Bom.) , the Bombay High Court, held as under:\n\"38. From  the above discussions, we are of the opinion that though assets were sold, sale of assets by\nitself woul d not be transfer of business in whole or in part. There must be material on record to show that\nthe business has been transferred to the petitioner and consequent thereto the petitioner has succeeded in\nsaid business. Respondent Nos.2 and 3 on the facts of this case have not procee ded under the proviso to\nSection 1 1 of the Central Excise Act.\"\n9. In Sri Jayajothi Co. Ltd. v. CCE  2010 SCC Online Mad 6002 , the High  Court of Madras in the context of\nSection 1 1 of the Central Excise Act, 1944, observed as follows in Para 9.\n\"9. A close reading of the above provisi on would make it abundantly clear that only in a case where the\ntransfer or otherwis e disposal of the business or trade in whole or in part effects any change in the\nownership thereof, in consequence of which the transferee succeeds in such business or trade, such\nperson, who succeeds in the business, is liable to pay the dues. xxxxxxxxxxx.\"\n10. There cannot be any dispute on the proposition of law, as laid down in the judgments (supra ). But, the\ncrucial question is whether there is transfer of business or not, which basica lly is a question of fact, and\nrequires determination based on evidence or material to arrive at a definite finding. The impugned order\nrecords that there was transfer of business. We are of the view that such a question can well be determined by\nthe appellate authority . It is not such a ground that cannot be taken before the appellate authority .\n11. We are not convinced with the submission that the impugned order is without jurisdiction. The reason is\nthat the order on the face of it cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. It is not the argument of the learned\ncounsel for petitioner that the authority passing the impugned order inherently lacked jurisdiction. We, in the\nexercise of the writ jurisdiction, at this stage do not consider it appropriate to enter into the disputed question\nof fact.\n12. Therefore, leaving it open to the petitioner to avail the statutory alternative remedy , if so advised, this Writ\nPetition is dismissed only on the ground of statutory alternative remedy . There shall be no order as to costs.\n13. As a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall also stand closed.*In favour of revenue."}

The petitioner's case is thus:TIWARI(a) Vide reference No.ZA370322026688E, dated 19-3-2022, the 1st respondent cancelled the GST\nRegistration of the petitioner w.e.f., 19-3-2022 for the reason of failure on the part of the petitioner\nto file returns for a period of six months prior to issuance of the show-cause notice dated 19-3-\n2022.\n(b) Aggrieved thereby , the petitioner filed appeal  before the 2nd respondent and vide order\nNo.ZD371 122018026X, dated 29-11-2022, the appeal  was dismissed on the sole ground that the\nappeal  was filed with a delay of 134 days and as per Section 107 of the GST Act, the delay could be\ncondoned for a period of one month and since the appeal  was exceeding the limitation, the appellate\nauthority  is not vested with the powers to condone the said delay beyond 30 days. Accordingly , the\nappeal  was rejected for admission.\nHence, the present writ petition.\n3. Learned counsel for petitioner , Sri Srinivasa Rao Kudupudi, would mainly urge that the petitioner has a\ngood ground to seek for restoration of his registration and in fact, he has mentioned the reasons for non-filing\nof the returns and on a technical ground that appeal  was filed beyond the condonable period, the appeal  was\nrejected and since the GST Tribunal  has not been constituted under Section 109 of the CGST Act, the\npetitioner has no other go except invoki ng the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.\nHe would thus pray to allow the writ petition and remit the matter back to the primary authority  to consider\nthe petitio ner's case and pass appropriate orders. He would rely upon the order of the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court for the State of Telangana in Chenna Krishnama Charyulu Karampudi  v. Addl. Commissioner\nAppeals  [2022] 142 taxmann .com 70/94 GST 376 (Telangana) , where under in similar circumstances, the writ\npetition was allowed and the matter was remitted to the primary authority  for reconsideration of petitioner's\ncase.\n4. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes \u2013 II opposed the writ petition stating that the petitioner\nhas not filed the appeal  within the time and instead filed the appeal  beyond the condon able period and\ntherefore, the 2nd respondent has rightly rejected the appeal . Therefore, order of the appellate  authority  suffer\nno legal flaw and the writ petition is not maintainable.\n5. We perused the record and also the decision in Chenna Krishnama  (supra ). In similar circumstances,\nlearned Division Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana having considered the fact that GST\nTribunal  has not been consti tuted under section 109 of the CGST Act and thereby , the petitioner could not be\nleft withou t any remedy , held that it would be just and proper if the entire matter was remitted back to the 2nd\nrespondent therein to reconsider the case of the petitioner and pass appropriate order in accordance with law .\n6. Needless to empha size that the above  said decision applies with all its fours to the case on hand. The\npetitioner preferred appeal  but it was rejected for the reasons discussed supra. In that view of the matter and as\nthe GST Tribunal  has not been constituted as per the provisions of the Act so as to enable the petitioner to\npursue his further legal remedies, in the interest of justice, we consider it appo site to allow the writ petition\nand remit the matter back to the primary authority  i.e., 1st respondent to re-consider the case of the petitioner\nand after affording a personal hearing to him, pass an appropriate order in accordance with law expeditiously\nbut not later than two weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order .\n7. With the above observation, this writ petition is allowed. No costs. As a sequel, interlocutory applications\npending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Heard Sri V.Siddh arth Reddy , learned counsel for the Petitioner , and Sri P.Shreyas Reddy , learned\nGovernment Pleader for Commercial T axes.\n3. As reque sted by the learned counsel representing both sides, the matter is taken up for hearing for final\ndisposal.\n4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner would submit that the Respondent Authorities, without following the\nprocedure of detention under Section  129 of CGST Act, 2017, directly invoked Section  130 of CGST Act,\n2017 and ordered the confiscation of the goods and the auction is schedule d to be held on 31.05.2024.\nLearned counsel further submits that it is a covered matter in the light of the Com mon Order dated 03.08.2023\npassed by a Coordin ate Division Bench of this Court in Arhaan Ferrous and Non-Ferr ous Solutions (P.) Ltd.\nv. Deputy Assistant Commissioner -1 (ST) [2023] 153 taxmann.com 325/99 GST 437/2023 (77) G.S.T .L.\n46/(2023) 9 Centax 171 (A.P .)/[Writ Petition Nos.15481, 15482, 15486 and 15487 of 2023].\n5. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes fairly conceded the same and would submit that the\nCourt may pass appropriate orders by imposing certain conditions.\n6. The petitioner's case is that he purchased iron scrap from one hawker , Mr. Shaik Nazeer Ahmed of Nellore\non 27.01.2 024 and sold the same in favor of M/s.Agarwal Foundries Private Limited, Naidupeta under an\ninvoice for a consideration of Rs.4,91,400/-. When the goods were in transit from Nellore to the consignee,\nthe vehicle was intercepted at Venkatachalam Toll Plaza by respondent No.1 and issued the impugned\nproceedings on the ground that the relevant papers do not cover the consignment. Learned counsel would\nsubmit that the petitioner has purchased the goods from an unregistered dealer and consignment is covered by\na valid invoice, W ay Bill, and relevant transport documents.\n7. As can be seen from  the record, proceed ings were issued for confiscation of goods in Form G.S.T MOV -10,\ndated 09.02.2024 by invoking the power under Section  130 of the CGST Act, 2017. The impugned\nproceedings dated 02.03.2024 would show that a show cause notice has been issued on 09.02.2024 calling\nupon the petitioner to explain, within fifteen days from the receipt of the notice, why the goods shall not be\nconfiscated. But the very next sentence would reveal that the petitioner is directed to appear before the Deputy\nAssistant Commissioner on 16.02.2024,  at 11.00 a.m., which would indicate that without giving fifteen clear\ndays, the matter is called on 16.02.2024. Hence, there is some force in the conte ntion of the Petitioner that the\nimpugned order passed in violation of the principles of natural justice.\n8. Needless to say, in the present case, respondent No.1 has detained the goods of the petitioner while they\nwere in transit from  Nellore to Naidupe ta. Respondent No.1 may initiate proceedings for confiscation under\nSection  130 of the CGST Act, 2017, in view of the absence of address of the unregistered dealer , from whom\nthe Petitioner purchased the goods. When it is the case of the petitioner that he bona fidely purchased the\ngoods from  an unregistered dealer for valuable consideration under authenticate d documents, it is his duty to\nestablish the same. As he claims to have  purchased the iron scrap from an unregistered dealer at Nellore, owes\na responsibility to prove the genuineness of the sale transaction. As rightly argued, the authorities can initiate\nproceedings under Section  129 of CGST Act, 2017 against the petitioner and conduct enquiry by giving\nopportunity to establish their case.\n9. Section  129 of CGST Act, 2017 speaks about the detention, seizure, and release of goods and conveyances\nin transit, whereas, Section  130 of CGST Act, 2017 deals with the confiscation of goods and levy of tax,\npenalty and fine thereof. The harmonious reading of Sections  129 and 130 of CGST  Act, 2017, keeping in\nmind the object and purpose, would construe that they are independent of each other . Section  130 of CGST\nAct, 2017 is not dependent to Section  129 of CGST Act, 2017. They are mutually exclusive.\n10. In the light of the discussion and the common Order dated 03.08.2023 in WP. Nos.15481, 15482, 15486\nand 15487  of 2023 passed by a Coordin ate Division Bench of this Court, to which I am one of the members,\nand considering the submissions made, this W rit Petition is disposed of giving liberty to the Respondent Nos.1\nand 2 to initiate proceedings against the Petitioner under Section  129 of CGST/APG ST Act, 2017 within  two\nweeks from  the date of receipt of a copy of this order and conduct enquiry by giving an opportunity of hearing\nto the Petitioner and pass appropriate orders in accordance with governing law and rules. In view of the same,\nthe auction notice impugned in the writ petition is set aside. In the meanwhile, Respondent Nos.1 and 2 shallANURAGrelease the detained goods in favour of the Petitioner on a deposit of 25% of their value and execute a\npersonal bond for the balance. They shall also release the vehicle bearing No. AP 0 27 X 4645 in favour of the\nPetitioner on executing a personal security bond for the value of the vehicle as determined by the concerned\nRoad T ransport Authority .

Heard learned counsel for petitioner Sri G.Narendra Chetty , Sri B.V.S.Chalapathi Rao, learned Standing\nCounsel for respondents 1 & 2 and Y.V.Anil Kumar , learned Central Government Counsel representing\nrespondent No. 3.3. Learned counsel for petitioner would submit that the dubious show cause notice dated 25-8-2023 was\nissued by the 2nd respondent stating that the registration of the petitioner is liable to be cancelled for \"non-\ncompliance of any specific provision in the GST Act or the Rules made thereunder as may be prescribed\".\nLearned counsel would submit that the show cause notice is as vague as it could  be since no specific provision\nwhich was violated by the petitioner was mentioned in the said show cause notice.\nLearned counsel would submit that since the issuing authority's name is not mentioned in the show cause\nnotice dated 25-8-20 23, the petitioner could not take immediate steps to file his reply . In the meanwhile, an\norder for cancellatio n of registration was passed on 3-10-2023 mentioning the effective date of cancellation of\nregistration as 25-8-2023. Learned coun sel would submit that the petitioner submitted an online application\ndated 28-12-2023 for revocation of cancellation, thereafter , on 10-1-2024 an order in Form GST REG-23 was\nissued by the Depar tment directing the petitioner to appear before the concerned authority on 12-1-2024. The\npetitioner submitted the supportive document  vide reply dated 23-1-2024. Learned counsel would submit that\nin spite of submittin g the record, the same was not considered and an order came to be passed on 24-1-2024\nrejecting the petitio ner's application for revocation of cancellation. Learned counsel for petitioner would\nsubmit that the petitioner has been conducting his trading activities from the same business premises where he\nearlier used to conduct manufacturing activities and there is no change in the location of his business\npremises. However , without considering the said aspect and record submitte d by him on 23-1-2024, the\nimpugned order of rejection for revocation came to be passed on 24-1-2024.\nLearned counsel thus prayed that the impugned order dated 24-1-2024 may be  set aside and the matter may be\nremitted to the 2nd respondent to consider the petitioner's submission with reference to his supportive\ndocuments and to pass appropriate order .\n4. Learned Standing Counsel for respondents 1 & 2 would submit that since the petitioner earlier failed to\nsubmit the cogent record showing that he is conducting trading operations from the same business premises\nwhere he was earlier conducting the manufacturing operations, his registr ation was cancelled and his\nrevocation applicati on was also rejected. He would submit that however , if the petitioner submits cogent\nevidence, the 2nd respondent will consider the same in right perspective and pass orders.\n5. In the light of the above respective submissions of both the learned counse l, the order of rejection of\napplication for revocation of the cancellation dated 24-1-2024 passed by the 1st respondent is set aside and\nmatter is remitted back to the 2nd respondent with a direction to consider the supportive documents said to be\nfiled by the petition er and also afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and pass appropriate order\nregarding the cancellation of the registr ation expeditiously , but not later than two (2) weeks from the date of\nreceipt of a copy of the order .\n6.

Raghunandan Rao, J. - The petitioner has registered a dealer under the Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017\nwith effect from 21.08.2018 in the Addanki Circle and thereafter , the registrati on was transferred to Bapatla\nCircle, Guntur -II Division. The petitioner who was earlier doing business in granite slabs or blocks had\nsubsequently cancelled his registration with effect from 30.09.2019. At the time of cancellation, which was\naccepted by the department, no taxes were shown due from the petitioner .2. Subs equently , a show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner in form GST DRC-01, dated 15.12.2021,\ninforming the petitioner that the Additi onal Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Enforcement), Bangalore,\nKarnataka had sent a communication dated 05.10.2021 stating that input tax credit of Rs.7,13,917/- has been\nfraudulently availed on the basis of invoices said to have been issued by one M/s. Manjunatha Marketing,\nBengaluru without actual receipt of goods. The show-cause notice called upon the petitioner to either furnish\nthe final return in GSTR-10 or to pay the wrongly availed ITC amount of Rs.7,13,917/-. The petitioner filed\nhis objecti ons dated 10.01.2022. The 1st respondent, who had issued the show-cause notice, had passed an\norder of assessment  requiring the petiti oner to pay tax of Rs.7,13,917/- and penalty of Rs.7,13,917/- apart\nfrom interest of Rs.5,44,298/-aggregating to Rs.19,72,132/-.\n3. Aggrieved by the said order , the petitioner has approached this Court by way of the present W rit Petition.\n4. Sri G. Narendra Chetty , learned counsel for the petitioner assails the said order of assessment on three\ngrounds as here under:-\n(i) Firstly , the learned counsel for the petiti oner contends that the assessment order , after extracting the\nobjections raised by the petitioner had rejected all the applications by stating that the contention of\nthe petitioner was thoroughly examined and it was found that the petitioner had not produced any\nvalid documentary evidence in support of its contention. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nwould submit that such rejection of all objections raised by the petitioner and without analyzing or\nconsidering any of them is arbitrary and violative of certain principles of natural justice as\nenvisaged by various Judgments of the High Courts and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n(ii) Secondly , the petitioner , in his objection s of 10.01.2022, had requested the 1st respondent to furnis h\na copy of the report of the Addition al Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Enforcement),\nBangalore, Karnatak a sent under the communication dated 05.10.2021. However , the said report\nhas not been furnish ed to the petitioner and as such no order of assessment could have been passed\nwithout furnishing the said report. The learned counsel for the petitioner also relies upon the\nJudgment of the Division Bench of the Common High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of Sri\nNallana Sambasiva Rao  v. State of Andhra Pradesh  (2015) 61 APSTJ 255.\n(iii) The Third  ground raised by the petitioner is that section 75(4) of the Goods and Service Tax Act,\n2017 requires the assessing officer to grant a personal hearing either if the assessee so requires or if\nthe assessing officer proposes to pass an order adverse to the interest of assessee. The learned\ncounsel for the petitioner would submit that in the present case, such an oppo rtunity of personal\nhearing should have been given to the petitioner as the assessing officer was proposing to pass an\norder adverse to the petitioner . He would also submit that no such notice of personal hearing was\nserved on the petitioner .\n5. In reply to these grounds, the learned Assistant Government Pleader for Commercial Tax would submit that\nthe objections raised by the petitioner were merely extracts of various Judgments of the various High Courts\nand a statement that all necessary docu ments were available with the petitioner . In such circumstances, the\nobservation of the assessing officer that no material has been placed before the assessing officer is sufficient\ncompliance with the requirement that the objections of the assessee should be analyzed.\n6. The learned Assistant Government Pleader for Commercial Tax would submit  that the notice for personal\nhearing was sent on 03.02.2023 for giving personal hearing on or before 10.02.2023 and the same was served\nby registered post with acknowledgment due. The noting on the registered post cover that was returned was\n\"no such person was available in the address\" of the office of the dealer . He would submit that the\nresponsibility of service of notice on the assessing officer is dischar ged upon notice being sent to the address\nof the dealer available in the record of the assessing of ficer. It is the responsibility of the dealer to intimate any\nchange in address, failing which the service of notice on the address registered with the assessing officer\nwould be suf ficient.\n7. On the question of non furnishing of the report of the Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes\n(Enforcement), Bangalore, Karnataka, the learned Assistant Government Pleader submits that the petitioner\nshould have approached the authority in person for perusal of the documents.\n8. As far as grounds 1 & 2 are concerned, this Court does not find any reason to interfere with the order of the\n1st respondent-assessing officer. A perusal of the objections raised by the petitioner would show that the saidobjections are extracts of various Judgments and a statement that all necessary documents are available with\nthe petitioner . In such circumstances, the observations of the assessing officer made above are sufficient\nresponse to the objections raised by the petitioner . Similarly , the absence of the petitioner at the address\navailable with the assessing of fice cannot amount to non-service of notice on the petitioner .\n9. However , on the question of non furnishing of the report of the Additional Commissioner of Commercial\nTaxes (Enforcement), Bangalore, Karnataka We respectfully follow the Judgment of Division Bench of the\nCommon Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Sri Nallana Sambasiva Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n(2015) 61 APSTJ 255, which had held that an assessment based on material and reports submitted by\nRegional Vigilance and Enforcement Authority can be upheld only when such reports are supplied to the\nassessee along with the notice of the assessment before any assessment order is passed. As the said report has\nnot been furnished, the subsequent assessment order which levied tax penalty and interest would have to be\nset aside.\n10. In the circumstances, this Writ Petition is allowed setting aside the impugned order of assessment passed\nby the 1st respondent in Form GST DRC-07, vide A.O.No.ZD370423028360Q, dated 18.04.2023 and\nremanding the matter back to the 1st responden t to take up the assessment proceedings after furnishing the\ncopy of the report of the Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Enforcement), Bangalore,\nKarnataka and after giving a opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner . There shall be no order as to\ncosts.\n11. As a sequel, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand closed.\n\u25a0\u25a0\n*Partly in favour of assessee."}

Bhanu Prakash in their presence on 17-11-2020, as illegal, arbitrary and\ncontrary to the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and its Rules, and violative of\nfundamental rights under articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 300(A) of the Constitution of India and also violative of\nprinciples of natural justice and consequently to setaside  the aforesaid proceedings.2. The case of the respondent department as can be seen from their counter is thus:\n(a) The writ petitioner with the assistance of his business accomplices passed fake Input Tax Credit\n(ITC) invoices on large scale in the name of different fictitious/shell firms within the States of\nAndhra Pradesh and Telangana during  the period July, 2017 to February , 2019 without actual\nsupply of goods in violation of CGST Act, 2017 and Rules. The investigation initiated by the\nOfficers of Director  General of GST (Intelligence), Visakhapatnam Zonal Unit revealed the said\nfact and they conduc ted searches in some of the premises of those fictitious/she ll firms operated by\nV.V Subba Reddy . The searches were conducted in the places like Guntur , Vijayawada,\nNarsaraopeta, Hyderabad etc., and they revealed that no business firms have operated from those\npremises and the CGST registrations were taken fraudulently in the names of different firms using\nwrong credentials/a ddresses with a view to passing of ITC by issuing fake tax invoices without\nactual supply of goods. Investigation further revealed that around 90 different firms are operated by\nV.V Subba Reddy for the purpose of claiming ITC by issue of fake tax invoices during the period\nand these firms operated in a network so as to conceal evasion. Some of the fictitious/shell firms,\nwhere searches were conducted, have admittedly purchased the fake tax invoices without actual\nreceipt of goods from the firms operated by V .V Subba Reddy . Investigation is still under progress.\n(b) The respondent officials have arrested Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy on 11-3-2019 for violation\nof section 132(1)( b) and section 132(1) (c) of CGST Act, 2017 and fraudulently passing on ITC by\nissuing fake tax invoices without actual supply of goods in the name of different fictitious firms.\nLearned Judge of Economic Offences Court, Visakhapatnam remanded Vennapusa Venkata Subba\nReddy to judicial custody on 12-3-2019 and later conditional bail was granted to him on 18-6-2019\nwith a direction to appear before the Investigating Of ficer once in a week.\n(c) From the statements of the Jaluri Sai Babu and some others, it is clear that there are a number of\nbusiness accomplice s of Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy who associated with him in creation of\nfictitious firms by collecting credentials from different individuals for the purpose of issue of fake\ntax invoices for fraudulent passing on ITC. In this background, the bank accounts of the fictitious\nfirms were  provisionally attached in the interest of protecting the Government revenue. As a part of\nit, the bank Locker No.39 standing in the name of the petitioner was also ordered for provisional\nattachment on 8-3-2019 in the interest of Government revenue and with a reasonable belief that\nsome incriminating documents/records relating to the case under investigation  and cash might be\nsecreted in those lockers.\n(d) Subsequent to the release of Vennapu sa Venkata Subba Reddy on bail on 18-6-2019, the 3rd\nrespondent addressed a letter dated 2-7-2019 to the Branch manager , Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Guntur\nand sent a copy to the petitioner inter alia intimating that the authorization was given to Sri\nBhaskar Prasad/the 4th respondent in W.P.No.8755 of 2019 to open and search the bank locker\nNo.39 standing in the name of the petitioner on 10-7-2019. However , the said date was postponed\nto 17-11-2019 vide letter dated 9-11-2020 of the Deputy Director . In the meanwhile the petitioner\nfiled the present writ petitions.\n(e) The contention of the respondents is that the bank accounts were attached and lockers were sought\nto be opened as a part of the investigation and by following the CGST Act and Rules and therefore,\nthe petitioner cannot claim any violation of his rights.\n3. Heard Sri V.V. Lakshmi Narayana, learned counsel for petitioner and Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar , Senior Standing\nCounsel for Central Excise, Customs and Service T ax representing respondent Nos.1 to 5.\n4. The main contentio n of the learned counsel for petitioner is that while attaching  the bank locker No.39 vide\nimpugned proceedings, no show cause notice was served on the petitioner to offer his explanation. So also the\nbank locker number -39 of the petitioner  was freezed and no opportunity was given to the petitioner to submit\nhis explanation. Due to freezing of locker, the petitioner is suffering a lot. Henc e, principles of natural justice\nwere infringed. Learned counsel vehemently argued that the petitioner has not committed any offences as\nalleged. He thus, prayed to allow the writ petition.\n(a) Per contra, Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar , representing the respondents, vehemently opposed the writ\npetitions arguing that the petitioner opened around 90 shell companies and created fake invoices\nwithout actual supply of goods and thus cheated Government. He woul d submit that theS.K. JAINinvestigation is in the prime stage and department reasonably believes that opening of the lockers of\nthe petitioner and other shell companies will provide necessary document s and money etc.,\nconnected to the case. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n5. The point for consideration is whether the there are merits in the writ petitions to allow?\n6. We gave our anxiou s consideration to the above respective submissions. A perusal of the remand report, a\ncopy of which is filed along with the material papers by the petitioner would show that the Senior Intelligence\nOfficer levelled allegations against the petitioner that he was indulged in issue  of fake GST invoices in the\nname of more than 70 fictitious/non-operating firms created by him at different locations in the States of\nAndhra Pradesh and Telangana without actual supply of goods to facilitate availment of irregular input tax\ncredit and thereby defrauded the Government's tax revenue. It is further allege d that search operations were\nconducted in the registered office premises of different enterprises and also the premises of the Accountant of\nthe petitioner and incriminating documents were recovered. Scrutiny of the documents revealed that the\npetitioner created 70 different fictitious/shell firms in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for taking GST\nregistrations. The modus operandi  of the petitioner was that he opened fictitious firms only on paper to issue\nfake GST invoices showing supply of iron and steel goods, chemicals, battery scrap, led etc. This fictitious\nfirms gene rally operated in three levels. The firms operating at first level in the chain, will issue fake invoices\nwithout actual supply of goods in the name of firms operating at second level without any corresponding\npurchases and thus first level firms will neither pay GST nor file monthly GSTR - 3B returns. The second\nlevel companies issue GST invoices in the name of firms operating at third level basing on the fake GST\ninvoices issued by the 1st level firms and these second level firms show payment of GST utilizing irregular\ninput tax credit taken basing on the invoice issued by the first level firms and accordingly , file monthly\nGSTR-3B returns. In turn, the firms operating at third level issue fake GST invoices without actual supply of\ngoods to different business firms/compa nies in consideration for commission and the firms operating at third\nlevel show payment of GST utilizing the irregularly generated ITC basing on the invoices issued by the\nsecond level firms and accordingly file monthly returns. Thus, there will be no money , bank transactions at\nthe first and second levels. However , bank accounts are opened with Lakshmi Vilas Bank in the name of firms\noperating at third level showing receipt of sale consideration through banking channels from different\nbusiness firms/companies in whose name fake GST invoices are issued for passing on ITC. In this process, the\npetitioner has issued fake GST invoices with a total turnover of Rs. 397,28,1 1,944/- without supply of goods\nto different business firms/companies by passing on a total fraudulent input tax credit of Rs. 61,30,33,274/- in\nrespect of 21 firms, out of more than 70 firms created by him and thus caused huge loss to the Government\nexchequer . The investigation is stated to be pending.\n(a) In furtherance of investigation, the Senior Intelligence Officer has attached the bank accounts and\nlockers of some of the companies on the apprehension that they are operating as shell companies\nfor Vennapusa Venkata Subba Reddy . Therefore, the locker No.39 of the petitioner was freezed\nunder section 83 of CGST Act, 2017 and decided to open through the authorized Of ficer.\n(b) Having regard to the above facts and circumstance and also in view of the fact that the matter has\nbeen seized by the learned Special Judge for Economic Offences-cum-IV Additional Metropolitan\nSessions Judge, Visakhapatnam and also considering that the investigation is in crucial stage, we\ndeem it not apposite to consider the prayer of the writ petitioner . On the other hand, without\nexpressing any opinion on merits of petitioner's case, we consider it apt to direct the petitioner to\napproach Special Judge for Economic Offences-cum-IV Additional Metropoli tan Sessions Judge,\nVisakhapatnam for appropriate relief.\n7. Accordin gly, the writ petitions are disposed of giving liberty to the petitioner to approach the Court of\nSpecial Judge for Economic Offences-cum-IV Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Visakhapatnam and\nfile an application seeking appropriate relief in which case the said Court shall consider the same and after\nhearing both parties, pass an appropriate order in accordance with governing law and rules expeditiously . No\ncosts.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any , pending for consideration shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

Adi Siva V ara Prasad  for the Petitioner . Y.V. Anil Kumar , Central Govt. Counsel  for the Respondent.\nORDER\n \n1. The batch of four Writ Petitions is being disposed of by way of this Common Order as all the Writ Petitions\nraised the same issues.\n2. The common issue s in these cases is that the petitioners who are dealers registered under the Andhra\nPradesh  Value Added Tax Act, 2005 [for the short \"the AP VAT Act\"] had certain outst anding credits in their\naccount when the Andhra  Pradesh  Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 [for the short \"the AP GST Act\"] was\nbrought into effect from 01.07.2017. The dealers who had credit balances, arising out of unused input tax,\nwere permitted to transfer the said credit  balances under the AP GST Act and the said credit so obtained could\nbe used by the dealers for adjusting against the tax payable by them. The petitio ners, along with other dealers,\nhad applied for transfer of credits available in their ledgers under the Form Tran-1 and the said Forms were\naccepted and the tax credit available in their ledgers under the AP VAT Act were transferred to their ledgers\nunder the AP GST Act.3. Subsequently , it appears that an audit objection were raised that the tax credit available in the ledgers of the\npetitioners under the AP VAT Act as on 02.06.2014, at the time of the bifurcation of the State, cannot be\ntransferred from the AP VAT regime to the AP GST regime as Section 56 of the Andhra  Pradesh\nReor ganisation Act, 2014 only permits a refund.\n4. On the basis of this audit objection, the 1st respondent reversed the credit transfer to the extent of the credit\nbalance available, in the ledgers of the petitioners, as on 02.06.2014 and raised  demands for payment of the\nsaid taxes.\n5. Aggrieved by the said action of the 1st respondent, the petitioners have approached this Court by way of\nthese W rit Petitions.\n6. 1st responde nt had filed a counter affidavit, in which it is stated that the tax credit available to the\npetitioners as on 02.06.2014 could not have been taken into account, as the dealer could have taken benefit of\nthe said tax credit by seeking refund of the said amount under Section 56 of the Andhra  Pradesh\nReor gainsation Act, 2014. It also pointed out that the final intimation Form (Net 28 NCCF) issued in relation\nto the tax credit available to the each of the petitioners, as on 02.06.2014, had also contained a note, which\nstated that if the provisional net tax amount is not availed by the petitioners, by end of March-2016, then the\npetitioners would have to request the ST O/AC for refund of the same subject to refund audit.\n7. The contr oversy in the present case is whether the tax credit available in the ledgers of the petitioners, as on\n02.06.2014, on account of unused input tax, can be transferred to the AP GST regime or the only option\navailable to the petitioners was to seek a refund of the same.\n8. The entire  controve rsy revolves around Section 56 of the Andhra  Pradesh  Reogranisation Act, 2014 which\nreads as follows:-\n\"Section- 56: Refund of taxes collected in excess.\n(1) The liabil ity of the existing State of Andhra  Pradesh  to refund any tax or duty on property ,\nincluding land revenue, collected in excess shall be the liability of the successor State in whose\nterritories the property is situated, and the liability of the existing State of Andhra  Pradesh  to refund\nany other tax or duty collected in excess shall be apportioned between the Successor States of\nAndhra  Pradesh  and Telangana on the basis of population ratio and the State dischar ging the\nliability shall be entitled to receive from the other State its share of the liability , if any .\n(2) The liability of the existing State of Andhra  Pradesh  to refund any other tax or duty collected in\nexcess on the appointed day shall be the liability of the successor State in whose territories the\nplace of assessment of such tax or duty is included, and the liability of the existing State of Andhra\nPradesh  to refund any other tax or duty collected in excess shall be apportioned between the\nSuccessor States of Andhra  Pradesh  and Telangana on the basis of populat ion ratio and the State\ndischar ging the liability shall be entitled to receive from the other State its share of the liability , if\nany.\"\n9. Section 56 of the Andhra  Pradesh  Reog ranisation Act, 2014 deals with refund of tax or duty on property ,\nincluding the land revenue which is collected in excess and refund of the same would be the liability of the\nSuccessor State in whose territory the property is situated and in the case of any other tax the liability would\nbe on the Successor State within whose territory the place of assessment of such tax had been assessed.\n10. This provision relates to the liability of the Successor State, relating to refun d of taxes which are been\ncollected in excess of the liability of the tax payer . The tax credit available in the ledgers of the petitioners is\ninput tax credit, which is not tax paid in excess. Consequently , the provision of the Section 56 of the Andhra\nPradesh  Reogranisation Act, 2014 would not be applicable in the present cases.\n11. Accordingly , these Writ Petitions are allowed setting aside the impugned demand orders in Form GST\nDRC-07 vide Ref. Nos.ZD370421001564T , ZD370421001562X, ZD370421001563V and\nZD370421001565R dated 18.04.2021 issued by the 1st respondent. There shall be no order as to costs.\n12. As a sequel, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand closed.\n\u25a0\u25a0*In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - Petitione r prays for writ of mandamus  declaring the show cause notice dated 6-7-\n2022 in Form GST DRC-01-A issued under section 74(1) r/w rule 142(1)( a) of A.P. Goods and Services Act,\n2017 (for short \"APGST Act) by the 3rd respondent and consequent attaching of bank account of the\npetitioner maintained with 4th respondent bank without at first issuing notice under section 61 of APGST Act\ncalling for explanation of the petitioner and even without passing final assessme nt order u/s 74 of APGST Act\nis illegal, arbitrary and without jurisdiction and contrary to the provisions of APGST Act and consequently to\nset aside the show cause notice dated 6-7-2022 and direct the respondents to release the petitioner's bank\naccount.\n2. Petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner was trading in groundnut and registered under the rolls of 3rd respondent having GST\nidentification No. 37DPKPB1913PIZM.  The petitioner was regularly filing return till August, 2019\nand thereafter he suffered huge loss and wound up his business in August, 2019 and consequently\nhis GST registration was cancelled w .e.f August, 2019.\n(b) while so, a show cause notice dated 6-7-2022 in Form GST DRC-01-A under section 74(1) r/w rule\n142(1)( a) of APGST Act was issued to him by the 3rd respondent alleging that as per the\ninformation provided by the Additional Director , DGGI, Visakhapatnam the petitioner has\nfraudulently claimed Input Tax Credit of Rs. 11,84,600 (IGST) for Financial Year 2018-19 which\nwas adjusted in the TRP towards GSTR3B return liability of sum of Rs. 10,45,400/- for the period\nAugust, 2018 to August, 2019, howeve r it came to light that the petitioner passed the fraudulent\nITC invoic es to the purchasers. Thus the petitioner was called for either to submit explanation by\n13-7-2022 or to pay tax Rs. 11,84,600/- along with interest and penalty equivalent to tax amount u/s\n74(1) and 172 of IGST Act, 2017.\n(c) The petitioner's case is that he received above show cause notice on 16-7-2022 i.e., after the expiry\nof time granted for submitting explanation. Therefore, the petitioner personally approached\nrespondent No. 3 and submitted that all the business transactions of the petitioner firm were\ngenuinely covered by e-way bills generated for each supply with the vehicle numbers and\nconcerned locations and the purchasers were genuine traders  situated in the State of Telangana and\nsupplies were made to them during the course of inter-state supply and that he has not committed\nany fault. However , the 3rd respondent refused to accept the objections raised by the petitioner on\nthe ground that the time stipulated in the show cause notice for filing objections was over. He did\nnot consid er the submission of the petitioner that he received notice only on 16-7-2022 and\ninformed to the petitioner that final assessment order would be issued in due course.\n(d) Petitioner's grievance is that though final assessment order was not yet passed, in the meanwhile,\nthe salary account of the petitioner was attached and from out of the salary credited to the said\naccount, amounts are being deducted towards recovery of the tax amount. Such recovery shall not\narise till passing of the final assessment orders but the attachment was made prior to the final\nassessment order which is a provisional  attachment. A provisional attachment can be made u/s 83\nof APGST Act by the Commissioner of Taxes only. Such a provisional attachment order was also\nnot passed and comm unicated to the petitioner . It is not known whether any final assessment order\nhas been passed by the 3rd respondent.\n(e) Further case of the petitioner is that as per AP GST Act, GST is a self assessment regime\nwhereunder , every taxable person has to submit his monthly/annual income  in relevant forms,\nbasing on which the extent of tax liabilit y will be determined by the authorities. If the proper officer\ncomes to opinion that return filed by the assessee was faulty or there was discrepancy or he claimed\nexcessive ITC than entitled or claimed fraudulent ITC, the proper officer has the power toscrutinize returns u/s 61 of the APGST Act and issue notice to the taxable person to furnish\nexplanation. On receiving explanation the proper officer shall pass order either accepting or\nrejecting the return filed by the assessee . If satisfactory explanation is not provided by the assessee,\nproceedings under section 73 or 74 of the APGST Act can be initiated. In the instant case even\nwithout calling for any explanation from the petitioner in terms of section 61 of the APGST Act,\nrespondent No. 3 issued show cause notice u/s 74 of the APGST Act which is contrary to the\nscheme of the Act. Therefore the show cause notice is vitiated by law. Added to it, 3rd respondent\nhas not furnished material relied upon by the department for disallowing the ITC. Hence the writ\npetition, challenging the show cause notice u/s 74 of the Act and consequentia l attachment of the\nbank account of the petitioner .\n3. Respondent No. 3 filed counter opposing the writ petition inter alia  contending thus:\n(a) It is firstly contend ed that writ petiti on is not maintainable inasmuch as, the petitioner has\nefficacious alternativ e remedy of filing appeal. Nextly it is contended that the petitioner filed return\nfrom May, 2018 to February , 2019 and NIL return from March, 2019 to Augus t, 2019. Meanwhile\nreference was received from Additional  Director , DGGI, Visakhapatnam dated 31-5-2022 and also\na letter dated 5-7-2022 from Joint Commissioner (ST) Kadapa informing that the petitioner has\nutilized ITC of Rs. 11,84,600/- during 2018-19 on worth of transport of goods of Rs. 2,09,08,000/-.\nBasing on instructio ns of Joint Commis sioner (ST) Kadapa intimation Form GST DRC-01A was\nissued for payment of Rs. 1 1,84,600/- on 6-7-2022.\n(b) Until recei ving of information from DGGI, Visakhapatnam it was felt that whatever returns filed by\nthe petitioner were correct. Hence action was not initiated u/s 61 of the APGST Act. However , the\npetitioner who was new entrant to his business seemingly done huge business within a short span of\ntime. Therefore on receiving the information from DGGI, Visakhapatnam and Joint Commissioner\n(ST) Kadapa action was initiated u/s 74 of the APGST Act by issuing form GST 01A and in order\nto protect the revenue of the State, simu ltaneously the bank account of the petitioner was attached.\nThe petitioner could have produced revenue records like transport receipts, bank payment details,\ntoll gate receipts etc., to prove that his transactions were genuine.\n(c) When the taxable person has given misstatement of facts, action u/s 74(1) of the APGST Act will\nhave to be initiated unless and until he proved himself correct. The impugned notice is only an\nintimation to pay tax and the same is served properly as per the provisions of the Act.\n(d) It is further contended that when there is discrepancy between GST of Registr and GSTR 3B then\nonly notice u/s 61 of the Act will be issued. On the other hand, where ITC has been wrongly\navailed or utilized by reason of fraud or any wilful mistake or suppression of facts to evade tax,\nthen the notice u/s 74(1) will be issued as to why the assessee should not pay amounts specified in\nthe notice along with the interest and penalty .\n(e) It is further submitted that the petitioner before vacating the register premises did not inform to the\nproper officer and not fulfilled obligation of filing closing letter and also not filing return as per\nsection 45 r/w rule 81 of the APGST Act, 2017.\n(f) Finally it is submitted that it would only to protect revenue of the State the impugned provisional\nattachment order was issued. Respondent thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n4. Heard arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri B. Abhay Siddanth and learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T axes Sri Y .N. V ivekananda.\n5. The main plank of argument of learned counsel for the petitioner is that in terms of section 61 of APGST\nAct, the proper officer has to first of all conduct scrutiny of return submitted by the petitioner for the relevant\nperiod with referenc e to records produc ed by the petitioner and if any discrepancies are found in the return,\nthen the proper officer shall issue notice  to the petitioner to explain those discre pancies and in case of failure\non the part of the petitioner to give satisfactory explanation or failure to rectify the discrepancy , then only the\nproper officer can take up the proceedings under section 74 of the Act. Learned  counsel would lament that in\nthe instant case without scrutinizing the return for the Assessment Year 2018-19 u/s 61 and without finding\nany discrepancies and issuing notice to explain discrepancies and most importantly , without passing any\nreasoned order there on, the 3rd respondent has directly issued notice u/s 74 of the Act which is per se illegal\nand without jurisdiction.(a) Nextly . he would argue that the notice u/s 74 of the Act was served on him only after expiry of the\ntime granted to submit the reply . Even  though the petitioner approached the 3rd respondent and\nrequested to receive the reply and relevant record he unduly rejected his request on the lame pretext\nthat it was submitted after the stipula ted time. Hence the principles of natural justice were a\ncasualty in this case and thereby the impugned show cause notice is liable to be set aside. To\nbuttress his contention that without following the procedure u/s 61 of the Act, notice u/s 74 cannot\nbe issued, learned counsel placed relian ce on Vadivel Pyrotech (P.) Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner\n(ST) [2022] 144 taxmann.com 179/[2023] 95 GST 10/68 GSTL 120/[2022] 1 Centax 286\n(Mad.) /MANU/NT/8253/2022, Circle-II, Commercial T ax Department.\n(b) Learned counsel further argued that without receiving the reply and passing final order u/s 74 of the\nAct deciding the innocence or fraudulent intention of the petitioner in claiming ITC, the 3rd\nrespondent got attached the bank account of the petitioner which is against law. Learned counsel\nthus prayed to allow the writ petition.\n6. Per contra, learned Government Pleader while supporting the impugned notice would argue that as per the\nscheme of APGST Act, the proper officer may, in terms of section 61 of the Act scrutinize the return filed by\na registere d person with reference to the relevant records produced by him and if he finds any discrepancies,\nthe proper officer can issue notice to the registered person calling for his explanation relating to the\ndiscrepancies and if he fails to give suitable explanation or having admitted the discrepancies, if he fails to\nrectify such discrepancies, then the proper officer may initiate appropriate action u/s 65 or 66 or 67 or proceed\nto determine tax and other dues u/s 73 or 74. Learned Government Pleader would strenuously argue that in the\ncircumstances stated  in section 61, the proper officer may treat un-answered or un-rectified discrepancies as\nwillful mis-statements or suppression of facts to evade tax or wrongly availed ITC by fraud in terms of section\n74 and may proceed further and issue  show cause notice as to why action cannot be initiated. Learned\nGovernment Pleader would thus submit that one of the channels to initiate proceedings u/s 74 is to commence\nthe scrutiny proceedings u/s 61 and culminate with section 74. However , proceedings u/s 61 is not the only\nway to lead to section 74. On the other hand, learned Government Pleader would argue, in a given case,\nbasing on the information available, if it appears to the proper officer that the registered person has not paid\nthe due tax or short paid or tax was erroneously refunded or ITC was wrongly availed or utilized by reason of\nfraud or any willfu l misstatement or suppression of facts was made to evade tax, then basing on such\ninformation, the proper officer can directly invoke section 74 and issue show cause notice to the registered\nperson in Form GSTDRC-01 under rule 142 of APGST Rules, which was precisely done by the 3rd\nrespondent in this case. Learned Government Pleader would thus conclude that scrutiny u/s 61 is not always\nsine qua non for taking up proceedings u/s 74, rather in exigent circumstances, proper officer can directly\ninvoke section 74 and also attach the assets of the registered person for protecting the interest of the\nGovernment revenu e. Learned Government Pleader would further submit that the decision cited by the\npetitioner has no relevancy . He would further argue that the petitioner has an alternative efficacious remedy of\nappeal as against the impugned notice and that apart, since the matter is at the stage of show cause notice, he\ncan submi t his explanation/objection which will be considered as per law. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ\npetition.\n7. Points for consideration are:\n(1) Whether proceedings u/s 74 of APGST Act cannot be independently initiated without having\nrecourse to the scrutiny u/s 61 of the said Act ?\n(2) Whether the attachment of the bank account of the petitioner is illegal?\n(3) To what extent ?\n8. POINT No. 1: To answe r this point the scheme of APGST Act, 2017 with reference to the filing of returns\nby the registered person, their evaluation and taking up of consequential proceedings has to be perused.\n(a) As per section 59, APGST Act adopts the self-assessment methodology whereunder , every\nregistered person shall make self-assessment of the tax payable under the said Act and furnish a\nreturn for each tax period as specified u/s 39.\n(b) Section 39(1) obligates a registered person to furnish returns. As per section 39(1) every registered\nperson, other than an input service distributor or a non-resident taxable person  or a person payingtax u/s 10 or section  51 or section 52, shall furnish return for every calendar month showing inward\nand outward supply of goods or services or both ITC availed, tax payable, tax paid and other\nrelevant particulars. Then, inter alia, section 39(8) speaks that a registered person who is required\nto furnish return shall furnish NIL return for every tax period whether or not any supply of goods or\nservices or both have been ef fected during such tax period.\n(c) Then sub-section 9 of section 39 gives scope for rectification of defects occurred in the returns. It\nlays down that if a registered person after furnishing return discovers any omission or incorrect\nparticulars thereon other than as a result  of scrutiny audit, inspection or enforcement activity by the\ntax authorities, he shall rectify such omission or incorrect particulars within time permitted, subject\nto payment of interest.\n Thus section 39 speaks about filing of monthly return and rectification of mistakes by self-\ndisclosure of the registered person.\n(d) Then section 61 of APGST Act speaks of scrutiny of returns. It should be noted that since self-\nassessment method is followed under this Act, the department sometimes may take up random\nscrutiny of returns. In that context section 61 says the proper officer may scrutinize the return and\nrelated particulars furnished by the registered person to verify the correctness of the return and if he\nnotices any discrepancy , he will seek explanation from the registered person. In case explanation is\nfound acceptable no further action be initiated. However , in case no satisfactory explanation is\nfurnished within the stipulated time or after accepting the discrepancies, if the registered person\nfails to take corrective measures in his return, the proper officer may initiate appropriate action u/s\n65 or sections 66 or 67 or proceed to determine the tax and other dues u/s 73 or section 74.\n Perhaps relying to the above provision, the writ petitioner , it appears, vehe mently argued that\ninitiation of scrutiny  u/s 61 and follow up procedure thereunder are the sine qua non for taking\naction u/s 74 of the APGST Act. However , before resolving this controversial issue, some other\nrelevant provisions have also to be perused.\n(e) Then section 65 deals with audit of the accounts of a registered person by the tax authorities. We\nhave seen in the section 61 that on failure of registered person to either answ er the notice in the\nreturn or correct the discrepancies, one of the courses opened to the proper officer is to conduct\naudit of the accounts of the registered person.\n(f) It should be noted that section 65 is not guided by section 61 alone. Even withou t following section\n61 also audit of accounts can be underta ken. In this regard section 65 says that issuing notice to the\nregistered person, the Chief Commissioner or any officer authorized by him may undertake audit\nfor such period as may be prescribed. Unlike section 61 which is confined to scrutiny of return and\nrelevant materials furnished by the registered person, audit u/s 65 is a wider exercise of verification\nof books of accoun ts and other docum ents of the registered person for a specific period. After\nconclusion of audit, the proper officer shall inform his findings to the registered person. Where the\naudit resul ts in detection of non-payment of the tax or short payment or erroneous refund of tax or\nITC being wrongly availed or utilized, the proper of ficer may initiate action u/s 73 or section 74.\n Thus, it is manifestly clear that section 73 and 74 are not controlled by section  61 alone as argued\nby the petitioner . The proceedings u/s 74 can be taken up by resorting to the audit of accounts u/s\n65 also.\n(g) Then section 74 says that where it appe ars to the proper officer that any tax has not been paid or\nshort paid or erroneously refunded or where ITC has been wrongly availed or utilized by reason of\nfraud or any willful mis-statement or suppression of facts to evade tax was made, he shall serve\nnotice to the person chargeable with the tax to show cause as to why he should not pay the amounts\nspecified in the notice.\n9. It should be careful ly observed that section 74 starts with the clause \"where it appears to the proper officer\nthat any tax has not been paid\". The word \"appears\" has a wider amplitude subsuming in it not onlyr 61 and\n65 but also any other credible information from a different source. If the intend ment of legislature is to make\nsection 74 bound by section 61 and 65 alone, that fact would have been clearly depicted in section 74.\nHowever , we will not find any specific reference to section 61 or 65 in section 74 except the usage \"where it\nappears\"(a) It should be noted that literal or strict interpretation is essential for fiscal, tax and penal laws and the\nCourt cannot abridge or elongate the meaning of those statutory provisions, particularly , when the\nlanguage employed therein is plain, unambiguous and simple. The apex Cour t has reiterated the\nstrict rule of interpre tation in a slew of decisions. In Union of India  v. Deoki Nandal Aggarwal  AIR\n1992 SC 96=MANU/SC/0013/1992 the apex Court observed thus:\n\"14.** ** **. It is not the duty of the Court either  to enlar ge the scope of the legislation or the intention\nof the legislature when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous. The Court cannot\nrewrite, recast or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate. The\npower to legislate has not been conferred on the courts. The Court cannot add words to a statute or read\nwords into it which are not there.\"\nIn Doypack Systems (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  1988 (36) E.L.T . 201 (SC)/AIR 1988 SC\n782=MANU/SC/0300/1988 the Apex Court observed thus:\n\"58. The words in the statute must, prima facie , be given its ordinary meaning. Where the grammatical\nconstruction is clear and manifest and without doubt, that construction ought to prevail unless there are\nsome strong and obvious reasons to the contrary . Nothing has been show n to warrant that literal\nconstruction should not be given ef fect to.\n59. It has to be reiterated that the object of interpretation of a statute is to discover the intention of the\nParliament as expressed in the Act. The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain the\nintention of the legislature as expressed in the statute, considering it as a whol e and in its context. That\nintention, and therefore the meaning of the statute, is primarily to be sought in the words used in the\nstatute itself, which must, if they are plain and unambiguous, be applied as they stand.\"\n(b) The above statuto ry interpretative jurisprudence depicts that when the statute is clear , plain and\nunambiguous Court has to make a literal interpretation by obliging the Parliamentary supremacy , for, the\nlegislation is the domain of legislative body but not the Court. In the present case as already stated  supra\nthe phrase \"where it appears\" is a free, unfettered and unbound usage made by legislature and therefore in\nour view , the source for the proper officer to proceed under this provision can be held to be either under\nsection 61 or 65 or some other information but cannot be constricted to section 61 or 65 alone to reach\nsection 74 cannot be accepted. Thus in essence, the source for the proper officer to proceed u/s 74 may be\neither section 61 or 65 or some other fact. Therefore, we are constrained to reject the contra argument of\nthe petitioner .\n10. The decision of High Court of Madras (Madhurai Bench) in Vadivel Pyr otech (P .) Ltd.  case ( supra 1) cited\nby the petitioner can be distinguished on facts. In that case the writ petiti oner filed his return for the\nAssessment Year 2018-19 and later it was taken up for scrutiny by the proper officer u/s 61 of Tamil Nadu\nGoods and Services Taxes Act (TNGST Act) by issuing notice in Form ASMT - 10 dated 22-12-2021 by\npointing out certain discrepancies between GSTR3B GSTR 1 and GSTR 2A returns filed by the petitioner\ncalling upon him to pay the tax of Rs. 13,54,250/-along with interest. The petitioner submitted his explanation\nin Form ASMT 11 by furnishing relevant details. Then his grievance is that six months thereafter respondent\nofficer enquired the petitioner over pone as to whether the petitioner had paid the tax, interest and penalty\ndemanded  vide order dated 9-5-2022. Till then except issuing notice u/s 61 of the Act no further proceedings\nwere taken up to his knowledge and no order was passed. Thereafter on enquiry  by the petitioner , he came to\nknow that an order dated 9-5-2022 was passed by the respondent and summary notice in GST DRC 01 and\norder in GST DRC 07 were uploaded in the GST portal. In GST DRC 01 show cause notice certain\ndefects/discrepancies were pointed out which are different from the defects/d iscrepancies mentioned in the\nForm ASMT -10, dated 22-12-2021 which was earlier issued u/s 61. Challenging the same the writ petition\nwas filed wherein the grievance of the petitioner was that without passing an order on explanation submitted\nby him to the show cause notice issued in Form ASMT 10 u/s 61, the responde nt officer straight away issued\nshow cause notice in GST DRC 01A and passed order in GST DRC -07 u/s 74 by showing different set of\ndiscrepancies which is illegal. Agreeing with his contention learned single Judge of High Court of Madras\n(Madhurai Bench) observed thus:\n(e) It is thus clear that any proceeding in GST DRC-01A/1 culminating in an Order in GST DRC-07, if\npursuant to Scrutiny under section 61 of the TNGST Act ought to be preced ed by issuance of Form\nASMT 10. In the present case, though ASMT 10 was issued on 22-12-2021 pointing out certain\ndiscrepancies, the GST DRC-01 dated 15-2-2022 and the impugned order in GST DRC-07 dated 9-5-GK2022 are made on the basis of issues that are completely different from what was set out in Form ASMT\n10 dated 22-12-2021. As this Court is of the view that ASMT 10 is mandatory before proceeding to issue\nGST DRC -01, failur e to issue the same in respect of the discrepancies forming the subject matter in GST\nDRC-01 dated 15-2-2022 culminating in GST DRC 07 dated 9-5-2022 would vitiate the entire\nproceedings. It is trite law that when the Act prescribes the method and mann er for performing an act,\nsuch act shall be performed in compliance with the said method and manner and no other manner .\"\n11. Thus it is clear that the above observation was made by learned single Judge in the factual back ground\nthat at the inception  itself the proceedings were taken worth u/s 61 of TNGST  Act but not u/s 74 as in our\ncase. Therefore, the above decision is of no avail to the petitioner .\nAccordingly , this point is decided against the petitioner .\n12. POINT No. 2: As can be seen that the main allegation under impugned notice dated 6-7-2022 is that the\npetitioner has passed fraudulent ITC to the purchasers without actual supply of goods/services. In that context\nwhile issuing show cause notice to the petitioner , respondent authorities seems to have made provisional\nattachment of the bank account of the petitioner by resorting to section 83 of APGST Act.. Since the\npetitioner has not so far filed his objecti ons/reply to the notice, at this juncture it cannot be concluded that the\nattachment is illegal.\n13. Thus on conspectu s of facts and law, we find no merits in the writ petition. However , since it is the\nsubmission of the petitioner that he received impugned show cause notice only on 16-7-2022 i.e., after expiry\nof time granted for submitting explanatio n which was dated 13-7-2022 and though this fact was brought to the\nnotice of the 3rd respondent he refused to receive the explanation and relevant documents, we, in the interest\nof justice,  considered it apposite to permit the petitioner to submit his explanation along with relevant\nmaterial.\n14. Accordi ngly, this writ petition is disposed of giving liberty to the petitioner to file his\nexplanation/objections along with the relevant materials before the 3rd respo ndent within three (3) weeks\nfrom the date of receipt of copy of this order , in which case the 3rd respo ndent shall receive the said\nexplanation and material and consider the same after affording an opportunity of personal hearing to the\npetitioner and pass appropriate order in accordance with governing law and rules expeditiously . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any pending, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - W.P.No.6599/202 3 and 6601/2023 are filed by the petitioner challenging the\nnotices in Form GST ASMT -10 dated 28-2-2023 issued by 2nd respondent under rule 99 of the A.P. Goods\nand Service Tax Rules, 2017 (for short, 'the AGPST Rules') r/w section 61 of the A.P. Goods and Service Tax\nAct, 2017 (for short, 'the AGPST Act) calling for explanation of the petitioner with regard to the discrepancies\nfound in respect of the returns submitted by the petitioner for the tax period April 2019 to March 2020 and\nApril 2020 to March 2021 respectively .\n2. The petiti oner is engaged in supply of iron and steel purchased from the resident registered taxable persons.\nThe petitioner is a registered dealer under the APGST Act and an assessee on the file of 3rd respondent\nherein. While so, the petitioner submitted its returns for the taxable period April 2019 to March 2020 and\nApril 2020 to March 2021. The 3rd respondent, on having received alert note vide R.C.No.158/C/2020 dated\n21-12-2022 from the Regional Vigilance & Enforcement Officer/2nd respondent, scrutinized the aforesaid\nreturns and found the suppression of sales turnover in the returns submitted by the petitioner for both the\ntaxable periods and accordingly , issued notices of intimation dated 28-2-2023 regarding the discrepancies in\nForm GST  ASMT -10 under rule 99(1) of the AGPST Rules r/w Section 61 of the APGST Act and called for\nthe payment of the due tax/explanation within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice.\nHence, the instant two writ petitions.\n3. Heard Sri M.V.K. Murthy , learned Senior Counsel representing Sri M.V.J.K. Kumar , learned counsel for\npetitioner , and learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax-II representing the respondents 1 & 3, and\nlearned Government Pleader for Home representing 2nd respondent.\n4. Vehemently remonstrating the impugned notices, learned Senior Counsel would firstly ar gue that there is no\nprovision authorizing the Director of Vigilance & Enforcement in the State to conduct inspection of the\nbusiness premises of a registered dealer under GST law. Therefore, the impugned notices issued by 3rd\nrespondent on the strength of the alert note forwarded by 2nd respondent is a gross infraction of the GST law\nand on that ground alone the impugned notices are liable to be set aside as they are based on the unauthorized\nalert notes. He alternatively argued that even assuming for argument sake that the 2nd respondent has power\nto inspect the premises of the petitioner still he cannot himself forward any alert notes to the 3rd respondent\nfor the reason that under section 72 of the APGST Act, whenever the Chief Commissioner required the\nassistance of any public officers for implementation of the provisions of the APGST Act, he may call upon to\ndo so and on his requisition the Govern ment may by notification empower and require any class of officers\nother than the officers mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 72 to assist the proper officers in\nimplementation of the Act. Learned counsel while referring to section 72 would strenuously argue, in the\ninstant case there is no material to show that either the Chief Commissioner  issued any requisition to the\nGovernment seeking  assistance of the 2nd respondent being the Regional Vigilance & Enforcement Officer or\nthe Government issued any notification to that effect. Therefore, the impugned notices fell foul of the canons\nof law .\n(a) Secondly , learned Senior Counsel argued that section 67 of the APGST Act is the relevant\nprovision which enables a Proper officer not below the rank of Joint Commissioner or any officer\nauthorized by him to inspect any place of business of the taxable person on the ground that he has\nsuppressed any transaction relating to supply of goods or services or claimed Input Tax Credit in\nexcess of his entitlement or indulged in contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or\nengaged in business  of transporting goods or keeping the goods which escaped payment of tax etc.\nLearned Senior Counsel would submit  that in the instant case, in the impugned notices the 3rd\nrespondent has not stated anything about the authorization issued to him by the Joint Commissionerto either conduct the inspection or to issue the impugned notices. Since the notices suf fer the vice of\nlack of authorization under section 67, they are illegal and unsustainable and liable to be set aside.\nIn this regard he placed reliance on Prakashsinh Hathisinh Udavat  v. State of Gujarat [2019] 112\ntaxmann.com 124/31 GSTL 583 (Guj.)\n(b) Nextly , learned Senior counsel would argue that in spite of the representation dated 2-3-2023\nrequesting 3rd respondent to communicate copy of the report along with the alleged incriminating\nmaterial stated to be forwarded to him by the 2nd respondent, except the pre-prepared stock\ninventory , the 3rd respondent has not forwarded the inspection report of the 2nd respondent and\nother incriminating material and thereby the petitioner was deprived of valuable opportunity to\nsubmit an effective explanation/objectio ns to the impugned notices. He thus prayed to allow the\nwrit petitions.\n5. Per contr a, learned  Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes-II while supporting the impugned notices\nand opposing the writ petitions argued that in the instant case the impugned notices in Form GST ASMT -10\nwere issued by follo wing the procedure under rule 99(1) r/w section 61 of the APGST Act but not under\nsection 67(1) or (2) of the APGST Act. In expatiation, referring to section 67 he would submit that whenever\na Proper Officer not below the rank of Joint Commissioner has reason to believe that a taxable person has\nsuppressed any transaction relating to supply of goods or services or claimed input tax credit in excess of his\nentitlement or indulged in contravention of the provisions of the GST Act or rules to evade tax, then he may\nauthorize in writing any officer of the State tax to inspect the premises of such assessee under sub-section (1).\nHe would further submit, pursuant to such inspection, if he has reason to believe that any goods are liable for\nconfiscation or any documents or books  or things useful for the proceedings under this Act are secreted, then\nas per sub-section (2) he may authorize  in writing any other officer of the State tax to search and seize such\ngoods or documents . Learned Government Pleader would thus submit that section 67(1) and (2) would apply\nwhen the assessee acted in contravention of the provisions of the Act to evade tax and such attempts came to\nthe notice of the proper officer not below  the rank of Joint Commissioner . Then in order to ascertain the truth\nof the information, at first he may authorize an officer to inspect the premises of the assessee and later\nauthorize an officer of the State tax to search and seize incriminating goods or documents as the case may be.\nIn such an event, learned Government Pleader would submit, the officer of the State tax who proceeds for\ninspection or search and seize shall require the prior authorization of the proper officer not below the rank of\nJoint Commissioner . However , in the instant case, the proceedings were undertaken and impugned notices\nwere issue d not under section 67 of the AGPST Act but by following rule 99(1) r/w section 61 of the Act. As\nper section  61, after an assessee makes self-assessment and files returns for the relevant tax period, the Proper\nOfficer, under section 61 of the APGST Act, may scrutinize returns and related particulars furnished by the\nregistered person to verify the correctness of the returns and inform him of the discrepancies noticed and seek\nhis explanation thereto. Learned Gover nment Pleader would strenuously argue that in the instant case, the\npetitioner has filed its returns for the tax period April 2019 to March 2020 and April 2020 to March 2021.\nHowever , on receiving the alert note from the statutory authority i.e., the Regional Vigilance & Enforcement\nOfficer, Kurnool, pointing out the suppression of sales turnovers, the 3rd respondent in order to seek\nclarification from the petitioner issued the two impugned notices asking him to either pay the demanded tax if\nhe does not wish to challenge the notices or submit its objections within the stipulated time. Learned\nGovernment Pleader would argue in vehemence that the 3rd respondent is well within his powers and\njurisdiction to issue the impugned notices and the petitioner cannot clamour that the 3rd respondent cannot act\nupon the alert note forwarded by 2nd respondent on one hand and issue the impugned notices without\nauthorization on the other . He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petitions.\n6. Whil e so, learned Government Pleader for Home representing the 2nd responde nt while producing the copy\nof the G.O.Ms.No.504 dated 25-11-199 7 issued by the General Administration  (V&E-A) Department, would\nsubmit that in the said G.O., the role of the V igilance and Enforcement Department has been delineated, as per\nwhich one of the tasks of the Vigilance & Enforcement Department is to preven t the leakage of revenues due\nto the Government and in that context, the 2nd respondent and his officials while inspecting the premises of\nthe petitioner found stock variation and also sale of material without issuing invoices/bills and therefore, after\nobtaining the statement from the petitioner , forwarded alert note to the 3rd respondent for taking necessary\naction to prevent evasion of the tax. Learned Government Pleader would thus submit that the 2nd respondent\nhas authority to inspect the premises of the petitioner and forward the alert note to 3rd respondent and his acts\nare thus just and legal.\n7. The points for consideration are:(1) Whether the 2nd respondent has no statutory authority to inspect the premises of the petitioner and\nforward alert note to the 3rd respondent regarding the suppression of sales turnover and other\ndeficiencies and 3rd respondent cannot act upon the said alert note and issue impugned notices\ndated 28-2-2023 to the petitioner?\n(2) Whether the impugned notices are unsustainable in law for want of authorization from the Proper\nOfficer under section 67 of the APGST Act and hence liable to be set aside?\n8. Point No. 1: We gave our anxious consideration to the above respective arguments of either side.\nAdmittedly , the impugned notices dated 28-2-2023 were issued by the 3rd respondent on the strength of the\nalert note dated 21-11-2022 forwarded by the 2nd respondent stating that during his inspection of the premises\nof the petitioner , his team found sale of iron and binding wire by the petitioner without issuing any\ninvoices/bills and thus suppressed the sales turnover to avoid the tax. The 3rd respondent in his turn issued the\nimpugned notices dated 28-2-2023 and instructed the petitioner to either pay the demanded tax within 15 days\nor submit his objections by 14-3-2023.\n9. Be that as it may, a perusal of the G.O.Ms.No.504, General Administration (V&E-A) Department, dated\n25-11-1997 produce d by learned Gove rnment Pleader for Home shows that the Vigilance & Enforcement\nDepartment was constituted by the Government of A.P. vide G.O.Ms.No.269, General Admin (SC.D)\nDepartment dated 11-6-1985 to condu ct enquiries/investigations into specifi c allegations affecting public\ninterest and to take effective measures through its own machinery and achieve several objectives, one of\nwhich is prevention of leakage of revenues due to the Government. In the said G.O., it is further stated that the\nV&E Department is expected to carry out vigilance functions where Government spending is involved and\nenforcement functions in respect of the revenues due to the Government. The Head Office of V&E was\nreconstituted into following four wings  vide office order No. 283, G.A (V&E) Department dated 3-8-1995:\n(a) Revenue W ing\n(b) Engineering wing\n(c) Development works W ing\n(d) Natural Resources wing\nEach of these wings is headed by the Joint/Additional Director . Further , the officers working in V&E\nDepartment have jurisdiction and powe rs throughout the State of Andhra Pradesh in respect of matters to\nwhich the Executive Authority of the State extends. The jurisdiction of the V&E Department extends to all\ndepartments of the Government, State Public Sector undertakings, State Government companies, all local\nbodies like Municipalities and Zilla Parishads. Finally it is stated in the aforesaid G.O. that all the\nadministrative departments of the Government shall extend necessary cooperation to the V&E Department.\n10. Thus, the above G.O. pellucidly tells that the enforcement functions of the V&E  Department inter alia  are\nto safegua rd revenues due to the Government and in that context it is permeable in all the departments\nincluding the Tax department. We agree with the submission of the learned Government Pleader for Home\nthat in the matter of protection of revenue due to the Government in the form of taxes, the officials of the\nV&E Department, if need be, can make inspection in the premises of taxable traders. During course of such\ninspection if the officials of the V&E Department found the attempts of such traders in evasion of tax, they\ncan pass on the information to the concerned tax department. In our view , it is an exchange of information\nbetween two statutory authorities for safeguarding the revenue due to the Government. Therefore, we are\nunable to accept the contention of petitioner that the 2nd respondent has no statutory right to conduct\ninspection in its prem ises and forward the alert note to the 3rd respondent and the latter cannot act upon such\ninformation.\n11. We also cannot appreciate the other contention of learned counsel for petitioner that unless the Chief\nCommissioner requires the assistance of any public of ficer( s) in terms of Section  72(2) of the APGST Act and\nthe Gover nment issues a notification requiring such class of officer( s) to assis t the Proper Officer, no\nassistance can be extended by any public officer as in the instant case. For better appreciation, Section 72 of\nthe APGST Act is extracted as under:\n72. Of ficers to assist proper of ficers\n(1) All officers of Police, Railways, Custo ms, and those engaged in the collection of land revenue,including village officers, and officers of central tax and officers of the Union territory tax shall\nassist the proper of ficers in the implementation of this Act.\n(2) The Government may, by notification, empower and require any other class of officers to assist the\nproper officers in the implementation of this Act when called upon to do so by the Chief\nCommissioner .\nIt is true that when the Chief Commiss ioner requires the assistance of any other class of officers other than\nthose mentioned in sub-section (1), he may require such assistance and the Gove rnment may issue notification\nin that regard. However , apart from that, the Government with an avowed object constituted V&E Department\nunder G.O.Ms.No.269 and assigned certain functions, one of which is to safeguard the revenue due to the\nGovernment. In that context, the officers of the said department can share the relevant information with the\nCommercial Tax Department and assist them without any prior requisition. The powers conferred under\nG.O.Ms.Nos.269 and 504 are independe nt and exclusive and they are in aid to the Tax department but not in\nderogation to section 72(2) and in our view, there is no conflict between the powers and functions of the V&E\nDepartment and the power of Chief Commissioner to make requisition to the Government under section 72(2)\nof the APGST Act. This point is answered accordingly .\n12. Point No. 2: Regarding this point, as rightly argued by the learned Government Pleader for Commercial\nTaxes-II, the 3rd respondent issued impugned notices in terms of rule 99(1) of the APGST Rules r/w Section\n61 of the APGST Act but not under section 67 of the Act. As per section 61, during the scrutiny of the returns\nand related particulars submitted by an assessee, if the proper officer finds any discrepancies, he may seek\nexplanation of the assessee and if such explanation is found acceptable, no further action shall be taken or\notherwise if the assessee fails to furnish  satisfactory explanation or fails to take the corrective measures in his\nreturn in which the discrepancy is accepted, the Proper Officer may initiate appropriate action. In the instant\ncase, the 3rd respondent in the light of alert note forwarded by 2nd respondent, only issued the impugned\nnotices to the petiti oner either to pay the demanded tax if he accepts the discrepancies or to submit its\nobjections/explanations within the stipulated time. At this stage, no action was contemplated to inspect the\npremises of the petitioner or to search and seize any goods or books of account as contemplated under section\n67 of the Act. As such, in our view , no authorization is required to the 3rd respo ndent under section 67 of the\nAPGST Act to issue the impugned notices calling for objections. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner\nthat the notices became illegal for want of authorization under section 67 of the APGST Act is untenable.\nConsequently the decision in Prakashsinh Hathisinh Udavat  (supra ) relied upon by the petitioner is of no\navail, as in the said decision the High Court of Gujarat deprecated the act of Assistant Commissioner in\nseizing the car and mobile phones of the petitioner without having any authorization given by the Proper\nOfficer in terms of section 67(2) of the Gujarat Goods and Service Tax Act. Needlesss to emphasize that the\npresent case is of not that ilk. Thus, section 67 has no relevancy in the instant case.\n13. Be that as it may, a pertinent question will arise here that even for acting under rule 99(1) of the APGST\nRules r/w section 61 of the APGST Act, whether the 3rd respondent requires any authorization. This question\nwould arise because in rule 99 as well as in section 61 the word 'Proper Officer' is employed and it is stated\nthat the Proper Officer may scrutinize the returns submitted by the registered person. In this context, section\n2(91) of the APGST Act defines 'Proper Of ficer' as follows:\n\"Proper Officer\" in relation to any function to be performed under this Act, means the Chief\nCommissioner or the of ficer of the State tax who is assigned that function by the Chief Commissioner .\"\nThe 3rd respondent who issued the impugned notices is the Deputy Commissioner (ST) but not the Chief\nCommissioner . Therefore, in order to issue the impugned notices, the 3rd respondent requires the\nauthorization of the Chief Commissione r assigning the task of issuing notices under rule 99 r/w Section 61 of\nthe Act. In the impugned notices, neither any reference is made about such authorization nor it was filed\nseparately in the Court. Therefore, we are constrained to hold that the two impu gned notices suffer the vice of\nlack of authorization by the Proper Officer i.e., Chief Commissioner . Therefore, the impugned notices are\nliable to be set aside. However , that will not preclude the Chief Commissione r or the officer authorized by\nhim to issue fresh notices under rule 99 of the APGST Rules r/w section 61 of the APGST Act.\n14. In the result, these Writ Petitions are allowed and the impugned notices dated 28-2-2023 are set aside with\nan observation that the respondent authorities are at liberty to issue fresh notices under rule 99 of the APGST\nRules r/w section 61 of the APGST Act either through the Chief Commissioner or any other Officer of the\nState Tax authorized  by the Chief Commissioner in that regard. Such notices can be issued to the petitioner\ncalling for objections by furnishing copies of the relevant documents forwarded by the 2nd respondentPOONAMthrough his alert note. In such event, the petitioner shall submit its objections within the time stipulated in the\nnotices and thereupon the Proper Officer after affording personal hearing to the petitioner pass an appropriate\norder on merits in accordance with law . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

The petiti oner by means of this writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitu tion of India is challenging\nthe Final Audit Report dated 22-12-2023 (Ex.P1).\n3. The challenge is mainly on the ground  of violation of the principles of natur al justice. The submission is\nthat the petitioner had filed reply dated 19-12-2023 to the discrepancy notic e under Rule 101 (4) of the\nAndhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax/Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 (in short,\nAPGST/CGST Rules, 2017) served on the petitioner on 12-12-2022, but without considering the same the\nFinal Audit Report was submitted.4.

The circumstances, which lead to filing of the writ petition are as under:The petiti oner herein is a company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. It\nmanufactures grain based extra neutral alcohol and also bottles Indian made foreign liquor . It is also registered\nunder Central Goods Services Tax Act, 2017. While things stood thus, the 3rd respondent herein issued a\nletter dated 21-7-2020 in Form GSTR-3 A under section 46 of the CGST Act on the ground that the petitioner\nfailed to submit its returns in GSTR-3 B for the months of January , 2020 to June, 2020 and as such, the\npetitioner was directed to file fresh returns within 15 days. In view of the non-response on the part of the\npetitioner in furnishing returns, an assessment order  came to be passed by the 3rd respondent on 13-8-2020\ndetermining the liability at Rs. 1,85,17 ,721/- towards IGST and Rs. 1,39,39,6 56/- each towards CGST and\nAPGST apart from a sum of Rs. 3,36,79 8/- as cess payable by the petitioner for the tax period January , 2020\nto June, 2020.

Thereafter , the very same authority namely , the 3rd respondent herein\nissued another communication titling it as rectification order  on 12-11-2020 under section 161 of CGST Act\nin order  to ratify the Corrigendum -cum-Addendum dated 27-8-2020, by which additions were inserted to the\noriginal order  of assessment dated 13-8-2020. Since the rectification order  dated 12-11-2020 being the latest\none having imbibed the earlier two orders  dated 13-8-2020 and 27-8-2020, was appealed in the prescribed\nform under section 107 of the CGST Act. It is stated that without looking into the rule position, the 2nd\nrespondent passed the order  dated 29-7-2021 confirming the proceedings of the 3rd respondent dated 12-11-\n2020. As there is no Tribunal functioning, the petitioner was forced to file this writ petition challenging these\norders .\n4. Sri Dr.M.V.K.Moorthy , learned Senior Counsel, would submit that the entire procedure followed by the\nauthorities in imposing penalty without hearing the petitioner is illegal and incorrect. He further submits that\nthis is a fit case, where the authority should issue a fresh show cause notice and then deal with the same afresh\nin accorda nce with law. He further submits that reviewing of the order  of the self same authority imposing\nadditional liability , without hearing the petitioner or without giving an opportunity of hearing the petitioner is\nillegal and against all cannons of law . He took us to provisions of law , in support of his plea.\n5. On the other hand, Sri S.V.S.Prasada Rao, learned Standing Counsel for respondent Nos.2 to 4, though\nopposed the arguments advanced by learned Senior Counsel, however , submits that even if the argument of\nthe learned Senior Counsel is accepted, the matter may have to be remanded for fresh consideration in\naccordance with law . He further submits that there is no bar for imposing penalty under sections 62 and 122 of\nthe Act. He further  submits that the entire action came to be initiated as the petitioner failed to pay its\nperiodical GSTR-3B returns within the prescribed due date.\n6. In order  to appreciate the arguments advanced, it will be appropriate to refer to certain provisions of law,\nwhich are as under:\n7. Section 62 of the Act deals with assessment of non-filers of returns, which is as under:\n(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 73 or section 74, where a registered\nperson fails to furni sh the return under section 39 or section 45, even after the service of a notice\nunder section 46, the proper officer may proceed to assess the tax liability of the said person to the\nbest of his judgment taking into account  all the relevant material which is available or which he has\ngathered and issue an assessment order  within a period of five years from the date specified under\nsection 44 for furnishing of the annual return for the financial year to which the tax not paid relates.\n(2) Where the registered person furnishes a valid return within thirty days of the service of the\nassessment order  under sub section (1), the said assessment order  shall be deemed to have been\nwithdrawn but the liability for payme nt of interest under sub-section (1) of section 50 or for\npayment of late fee under section 47 shall continue8. Section 122 of the Act deals with pena lty for certain offences. It would be necessary for us to extract the\nsame, which is as under:\n(1) Where a taxable person who\u2014\n(i) supplies any goods or services or both without issue of any invoice or issues an incorrect or false\ninvoice with regard to any such supply;\n(ii) issues any invoice or bill without supply  of goods or services or both in violation of the provisions\nof this Act or the rules made thereunder;\n(iii) collects any amount as tax but fails to pay the same to the Government beyond a period of three\nmonths from the date on which such payment becomes due;\n(iv) collects any tax in contravention of the provisions of this Act but fails to pay the same to the\nGovernment beyond a period of three months from the date on which such payment becomes due;\n(v) fails to deduct the tax

less than the amount required to be collected under the said sub-section or where\nhe fails to pay to the Government the amount collected as tax under sub-section (3) of section 52;\n(vii) takes or utilises input tax credit withou t actual receipt of goods or services or both either fully or\npartially , in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder;\n(viii) fraudulently obtains refund of tax under this Act;\n(ix) takes or distributes input tax credit in contravention of section 20, or the rules made thereunder;\n(x) falsifies or substitutes financial records or produces fake accounts or documents or furnishes any\nfalse information or return with an intention to evade payment of tax due under this Act;\n(xi) is liable to be registered under this Act but fails to obtain registration;\n(xii) furnishes any false information with regard to registration particulars, either at the time of applying\nfor registration, or subsequently;\n(xiii) obstructs or prevents any of ficer in dischar ge of his duties under this Act;\n(xiv) transports any taxable goods without the cover of documents as may be specified in this behalf;\n(xv) suppresses his turnover leading to evasion of tax under this Act;\n(xvi) fails to keep, maint ain or retain books  of account and other documents in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder;\n(xvii) fails to furnish infor mation or documents called for by an officer in accordance with the provisions\nof this Act or the rules made thereunde r or furnishes false information or documents during any\nproceedings under this Act;\n(xviii) supplies, transports or stores any goods  which he has reasons to believe are liable to confiscation\nunder this Act;\n(xix) issues any invoice or document by using the registration number of another registered person;\n(xx) tampers with, or destroys any material evidence or document;\n(xxi) disposes off or tampers with any goods that have been detained, seized, or attached under this Act,\nhe shall be liable to pay a penalty of ten thousand rupees or an amount equivale nt to the tax evaded\nor the tax not deducted under section 51 or short deducted or deducted but not paid to the\nGovernment or tax not collected under section 52 or short collected or collected  but not paid to theGovernment or input tax credit availed of or passed on or distributed irregularly , or the refund\nclaimed fraudulently , whichever is higher .\n(2) Any registered person who supplies any goods or services or both on which any tax has not been paid\nor short-paid or erroneously refunded, or where the input tax credit has been wrongly availed or utilised,\n\u2014\n(a) for any reason, other than the reason of fraud or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts to\nevade tax, shall be liable to a penalty of ten thousand rupees or ten per cent. of the tax due from such\nperson, whichever is higher;\n(b) for reason of fraud  or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts to evade tax, shall be liable to a\npenalty equal to ten thousand rupees or the tax due from such person, whichever is higher .\n(3) Any person who\u2014\n(a) aids or abets any of the of fences specified in clauses ( i) to ( xxi) of sub-section (1);\n(b) acquires possession of, or in any way concerns himself in transporting, removing, depositing,\nkeeping, concealing, supplying, or purchasing or in any other manner deals with any goods which\nhe knows or has reasons to believe are liable to confiscation under this Act or the rules made\nthereunder;\n(c) receives or is in any way concerned with the supply of, or in any other manner deals with any\nsupply of services which he knows or has reasons to believe are in contravention of any provisions\nof this Act or the rules made thereunder;\n(d) fails to appear before the officer of central tax, when issued with a summon for appearance to give\nevidence or produce a document in an inquiry;\n(e) fails to issue invoice  in accordance with the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder or\nfails to account for an invoice in his books of account, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend\nto twenty-five thousand rupees.\n9. According to the learned Senior Counsel, this is the only provision, which deals with penalty for certain\noffences, which includes, cases where tax has not been paid or short paid on persons, who supplies any goods\nor services or both and where the input tax has been wrongly availed or utilized.\n10. Section 161 of the Act deals with rectification of errors apparent on the face of the record. It would be\nappropriate to extract the same as under:\n\"Without prejudice to the provisions of section 160, and notwithstanding anything contained in any other\nprovisions of this Act, any authority , who has passed or issued any decisio n or order  or notice or\ncertificate or any other document, may rectify any error which is apparent on the face of record in such\ndecision or order  or notice or certificate or any other document, either on its own motion or where such\nerror is brought to its notice by any officer appointed under this Act or an officer appointed under the\nState Goods and Services Tax Act or an officer appointed under the Union Territory Goods and Services\nTax Act or by the affected person within a period of three months from the date of issue of such decision\nor order  or notice or certificate or any other document, as the case may be:\nProvided  that no such rectifi cation shall be done after a period of six months from the date of issue of\nsuch decision or order  or notice or certificate or any other document:\nProvided further  that the said period of six months shall not apply in such cases where the rectification\nis purely in the nature of correction of a clerical or arithmetical error , arising from any accidental slip or\nomission:\nProvided also  that wher e such rectification adversely affects any person, the principles of natural justice\nshall be followed by the authority carrying out such rectification.\"\n11. A very reading of 161 of the Act makes it very clear that where any rectific ation adversely affects any\nperson, principles of natural justice shall be followed by the authority carrying out such rectification.12. Secti on 127 of the Act which has some importance deals with power to impose penalty in certain cases. It\nstates that where the proper officer is of the view that a person is liable to a penalty and the same is not\ncovered under any proceedings under section 62 or section 63 or section 64 or section 73 or section 74 or\nsection 129 or section 130, he may issue  an order  levying such penalty after giving reasonable opportunity of\nhearing such person.\n13. Keeping in view of the provisions of law , we shall now proceed to deal with the case on hand.\n14. In the instant case, Form GSTR-3A was issued on 21-7-2020 for not filing the returns within the time\nprescribed. On 13-8-2020, a notice came to be issued under rule 100(1) of CGST and SGST Rules,\n2017/APGST Rules, 2017 read with section 62(1) of the GGST Act, 2017/APGST Act, 2017.\n15. A reading of the said order  would indicate that if the petitioner fails to furnish the returns within a period\nof 30 days from the date of service of the said order , this order  shall be deemed to have been withdrawn in\nterms of section 62(2) of the CGST Act, 2017; otherwise, the proceedings shall be initiated against them after\nthe aforesaid period to recover the outstanding dues.\n16. Thereafter , Corrigendum -cum-Addendum came to be issued on 27-8-2020 inserting certain clauses, whic h\nare as under:\n\"2. In the said order  after para 4.7, para 4.8 is inserted and may be read as\n4.8 As per sub-section (2)(a) of section 122 of the CGST A/APGST A, any registered person who has not\npaid tax shall be liable to a penalty of ten thousand rupees or ten percent of the tax due from such person,\nwhichever is higher .\n3. In the order  cited, after para 7( iii), para 7( iv) is inserted and may be read as\n7. (iv) M/s SPYAIL are also ordered  to pay penalty of Rs. Rs. 18,51,772/- under IGST , Rs. 13,93,966/-\ntowards CGST & Rs. 13,93,966/- towar ds SG/UT GST and Rs. 3,36,800/- towards Cess for tax periods\nJanuary 2020 to December 2020 (detailed in Annexure) as required under section 122(2)( a) of the\nCGST A/APGST A.\"\nAs observed earlier another rectification dated 12-1 1-2020 came to be issued imposing the following:\n\"2. In the order  dated 13-8-2020 after para 4.7, para 4.8 is inserted and may be read as\n4.8 As per sub-section (2)(a) of Section 122 of the CGST A/APGST A, any registered person who has not\npaid tax shall be liable to a penalty of ten thousand rupees or ten percent of the tax due from such person,\nwhichever is higher .\n3. In the order  dated 13-8-2020, after para 7( iii), para 7( iv) is inserted and may be read as\n7. (iv) M/s SPYAIL are also ordered  to pay penalty of Rs. Rs. 18,51,772/- under IGST , Rs. 13,93,966/-\ntowards CGST & Rs. 13,93,966/- towar ds SG/UT GST and Rs. 3,36,800/- towards Cess for tax periods\nJanuary 2020 to june 2020 (detailed in Annexure) as required under Section 122(2)( a) of the\nCGST A/APGST A.\"\n17. A reading of the above would clearl y indicate that penalties have been imposed creating additional\nliability on the petitioner , which was not reflected in the earlier notice dated 13-8-2020. No opportunity of\nhearing was given to the petitioner while imposing the said penalty .\n18. As stated earlier section 62 of the Act does not anywhere speaks about impos ing penalty . It only speaks\nabout liability for payment of interest sub-section (1) of section 50 or for payme nt of late fee under section 47\nof the Act. Further , if the penalty is to be imposed in cases, which are not covered under section 62 or section\n63 or section 64 or section 73 or section 74 or section 129 or section 130, the authority can impose penalty\nafter giving reasonable opportunity of hearing such person. Further as observed earlier , under section 161 of\nthe Act any rectification, which adversely affects any person is possible only after following the principles of\nnatural justice. Since the order  impugned substantially affects the assessee as penalty is sought to be imposed,\nwhich demand did not form part of notice dated 13-8-2020, without giving an opportunity of hearing, the\norders  under challenge are set aside. However , the respondents are permitted to proceed further by issuing a\nfresh notice and pass orders  in accordance with law .\n19. Accordingly , the W rit Petition is allowed. No costs.SB20. All pending miscellaneous petitions if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Praveen Kumar , J. - The Present Writ Petition came to be filed by the Petitioner challenging the Order -in-\nAppeal No. ZH3710OD19206, dated 20-10-2020, passed by the 1st Responden t demanding the Petitioner topay GST amounting to Rs. 63,00,19,512/- for the period from November 2017 to September 2018 along with\ninterest and penalties equal to 10% of the tax demanded.\n2. The Petiti oner is a company engaged as a contractor by various entities for supply, installation, testing and\ncommissioning of Solar  Power  Generating System.\n3. Realizing the impo rtance of regenerative nature and cheap cost of product, the Government accorded\ngreater importance for setting up of solar  power  projects and imposed Goods and Service Tax at 5% (2.5%\nCGST and 2.5% SGST) on solar  equipment. However , the services relating to setting up of solar  power\nprojects are char ged GST at 18% (9% CGST and 9% SGST).\n4. The Petiti oner herein, used to enter into contracts with prospective buyers of solar  power  plants  for supply\nand installation of equipment under turnkey basis and paid GST at 5% on supply  value of equipment and 18%\non the erection and installation of the said equipment.\n5. It is submitted that, the import duty/GS T on the inputs procured by the Petitioner i.e. on solar  modules and\nsteel was char ged at 18% as against the GST rate of 5% on the finished goods cleared by the Petitioner . Due to\nthis inverted duty structure, the Petitioner accumulated Input Tax Credit. To have cash flow, the Petitioner\nfiled a refund appli cation for accumulated ITC, citing inverted duty structure, and claimed refund of Rs.\n8,65,63,538/- for period from January 2018 to March 2018. However , the said claim was rejected by the\ncompetent authority , aggrieved by which, Petitioner filed an appeal.\n6. While things stood thus, the Assistant Commissioner of State Tax issued notice  dated 17-9-2019, proposing\ndemand of GST @ 18% on the ground that the proposing assessment activity rendered by the petitioner is\nunder the Works Contract Service and has nothing to do with the supply of Goods and provisions of Service\nand accordingly demanded GST @ 18% of the value of the supply .\n7. A reply came to be filed disputing the claim made by the authorities. However , the original authority\nconfirmed the activity under the Works Contract Service and conseq uently demanded GST of\nRs.63,00,19,512/- (CGST - Rs. 31,50,09,756/- and SGST - Rs. 31,50,09,756/-) along with interest covering the\nperiod from November , 2017 to Septem ber, 2018 and imposed equivalent pena lty under section 74(1) of the\nGST enactments.\n8. Aggrieved by the Assessment Order , the Petitioner filed an appeal before first Appellate Authority under\nsection 107 of AP GST Act, 2017, by pre-depositing 10% of the GST .\n9. In appeal before the first Appellate Authority , Petitioner contended that supplies made by them do not fall\nunder the scope of Works Contract Service since the activity undertake n by them in erection and\ncommissioning of the solar  equipment, was for the limited purpose of operation ef ficiency and does not render\nthe same immovable and, if required, the equipment can be dismantled and reassembled at some other place.\nPetitioner also contended that merely because part of the activity involves civil works, the total supply cannot\nbe assume d to be works contract service, since the plant  is not immovable in nature. The activity rendered is a\ncomposite supply consisting of supply of goods, where the predominance is that of goods, thereby the\nprincipal supply is deemed to be the supply for levy of GST. However , the First Appellate Authority rejected\nthe contention of the Petitioner and confirmed the GST liability and imposed penalty of 10% of tax amount.\n10. Thereafter , the 2nd respondent vide DRC-09 dated 23-10-2020 issued a recovery of tax confirmed in the\nAppeal though a period of three months  is allowed, for initiating the recovery proceedings in terms of section\n78 of APGST Act, 2017. Challenging the same, the present writ petition came  to be filed before this Court\nmainly on the ground that only seven days was given to the petitioner to pay the dues.\n11. It is the contention of the Petitioner that the impugned order is not legal and proper and is in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice, as the impugned order communicated is without any preamble intimating the\nmethod and procedure.\n12. The finding of the Appellate Authority that the supplies effected by the Appellant are not composite\nsupplies, but works contract services which are immovable in nature, is incorrect. Placing reliance on\n\"Explanation  in Sl. No. 234 of Notification No. 01/2017-CT(Rate) dated 28-6-2017 and Sl. No. 38 of\nNotification No. 11/2017-CT(Rate)\", the Petitioner contends that the turnkey project of solar  power  plant  is\nnot treated as immovable property , as the value of supply of goods and services is differentiated through\ndeeming provision.13. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner relies upon the decisions of Hon'ble Apex Court in Sirpur Paper\nMills Ltd. v. CCE 1997 taxm ann.com 265 (SC) ; CCE  v. Solid & Corr ect Engineering Works [2010] 5 SCC\n122; Sri Velayuthaswamy Spinning Mills (P.) Ltd. v. Inspector General of Registration  Manu/TN/0164/2013:\n2013 (2) CTC 551; Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd.  v. CST [2018] 100 taxmann.com 245 (Delhi) ; I.G.E. (India)\nLtd. v. CCE 1990 taxmann.com 492 (CEGA T - New Delhi) (SB)  in support of his plea.\n14. A Counte r came to be filed by the 2nd Respondent disputing the claim made. It is contended that a perusal\nof the 'Engineering Procurement and Construction Agreement', would indicate that, the Petitioner was\nengaged in supply of services under Works Contract to Solar  Power  Plant  Developers under EPC contracts,\ninvolving supply of services and goods which fall under Works Contract. The business \"General Construction\nServices of Power  Plants  and its related infrastructure\" is liable to GST at 18%.\n15. The Respondent also contended that in view of explanation inserted against S.No.234 in the Notification\nNo. 24/2018- Central Tax (Rate), dated 31st December 2018, the turnovers reported by the Petitioner for tax\nperiods from November , 2017 to Septem ber, 2018 are liable to levy of GST at 18%, as the amendment came\ninto force with ef fect from 1-1-2019 and same has no retrospective ef fect.\n16. It is also the conten tion of the Respond ent that, the predominant nature of the EPC contract executed by\nthe Petitioner is the Development of Solar  Park assigned for the said purpose in running condition having a\nlife to generate solar  power  for a period of 25 years, to design, engineer , civil, land development, inter\nconnection, fixing, testing, etc. In the entire works contract, the supply of solar  power  panels are one of the\ncomponents and there are more essential items other than solar  panels and hence it cannot be considered that\nthe principle supply is Solar  Power  Generating System in the composite contract. It was further contended\nthat, from their self-declaration in the stock transfer invoices, the \"Solar  Power  Generating System\" is\nchargeable at 18%.\n17. The Solar  Power  Generating System supplied with fixtures cannot be moved as a movable item and it is\nnothing but develop ment of 'immovable property' and contract undoubtedly come under 'works contract' as\nper the provision of section 2(1 19) of the AP GST Act, 2017.\n18. Resp ondents also contend that, the judgments relied upon by Petitioner do not apply to present case and\nfurther contended that 'Asphalt Drum/Hot Mix plants ' which were subjec t matter of dispute in those cases\ncannot be compared with the Solar  Power  Generation Plant , as 'Aspha lt Drum/H ot Mix plants ' are instal led at\nparticular site till the completion of particular work and on completion of work, they will be shifted to another\nsite for another work. Whereas in the present work, the plant  is established such a way that same has to be\nworked without any shift for a period of 25 years.\n19. The learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes placed reliance on a ruling given by the Andhra\nPradesh State Authorities for 'Advance Ruling' in the case of McNally Bharat Engineering Company Ltd., In\nre [2019] 111 taxmann .com 501 (AAR - AP), wherein it was held that, Solar  PV Power  Project can be treated\nas Compo site Supply , as defined at section 2 of CGST Act, 2017 and APGST Act, 2017, and it is treated as\n'supply of service' in terms of Serial No. 6, Schedule II of CGST Act, 2017 and APGST Act, 2017. The\nsupply cannot be classified under Sl. No. 234 of Schedule I of the Notification  No. 1 of 2017 and the rate of\n5% is not applicable, as it is classifie d under Heading 9954, Entry No. (ii) of S. No. 3 of the table of\nNotification No. 11/2017, dated 28-6-2017, as amended from time-to-time and in view of corresponding\nNotification under APGST Act, 2017, the applicable rate of tax is 18%.\n20. An Addit ional Affidavit came to be filed by the Petitioner , wherein, it is averred that the petitioners are\nsupplying solar  power  plant  equipmen t and providing the supply of the service-erection and commissioning of\nthe said plant . As the supplies are bundled with each other , the supply effected by the Petitioner is a composite\nsupply and the supp ly which predominates in value is liable to be treated as principal supply , as per section\n8(a) of the CGST Act, 2017/APGST Act, 2017. As the value of supply of Petitio ner is 92% of the contract\nvalue, the GST at the rate of 5% is applicable to supply of goods on total value of supply .\n21. It is also contende d that the Respondent wrongly held the supplies made by the petitioner as 'works\ncontract' falling under entry 9954 in entry no (ii) of S.No.3 of table Notification No. 11/2017 and the\nexplanation rendered  under Notification No. 11/2018, dated 31-12-2018, but failed to consider the point as to\nwhy the transaction shall not be treated to be one falling within S.No.234 of Schedule-I of Notification\nNo.1/2017 dated 28-6-2017.GK22. At this stage, it would be appropriate to extract the relevant portion of the order impugned passed by the\n1st respondent appellate authority , which is as under:-\n\"In the present case, the contract entered by the appellant is composite supply of works contract as\ndefined at section 2(119) of CGST Act '2017' and is treated as supply of service in terms of serial no. 6,\nSchedule II of GST Act, 2017.

The amendment has no retrospective ef fect.\"\n23. However , a perusa l of Circular No. 163/19/2021-GST dated 6-10-2021 issued by the Department of\nRevenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, which is now placed on record, would show that GST\nCouncil has given clarity on specified Renewable Energy Projects that GST can be paid in terms of 70:30\nratio, for the goods and services, for the period 1st July, 2017 to 31st December , 2018, in the same manner\nprescribed for the period on or after 1-1-2019, as per the explanation in the Notification No. 24/2018 dated\n31st December , 2018. The relevant portion of the said Circular is as under:-\n\"13.3 The GST Council has now decided to clarify that GST on such specified Renewable Energy\nProjects can be paid in terms of the 70:30 ratio for goods and services, respectively , for the period of 1st\nJuly, 2017 to 31st December , 2018, in the same manner as has been prescribed for the period on or after\n1st January , 2019, as per the explanation in the Notification No. 24/2018 dated 31st December , 2018.\nHowever , it is speci fied that, no refund s will be granted if GST already paid is more than the amount\ndetermined using this mechanism.\"\n24. In view of the Circular No. 163/19/2021-GST , dated 6-10-2021, we deem it appropriate to remand the\nmatter back to the 1st respondent/Appellate Authority to consider the issue afresh in terms of the above\nCircular .\n25.

Siddharth Reddy  for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner prays for writ of mandamus declaring the action of the 1 st\nrespondent in cancelling the registration  of the petitioner under CGST/APGST Act, 2017 as illegal, arbitrary ,\nhighhanded and vitiated on account of violation of principles of natural justice and violative of Articles 19 and\n21 of the Constitution of India and consequently set aside the impugned proceedings of the 1 st respondent in\nForm GST REG-19, dated 15.07.2023 and pass such other orders deemed fit in the circumstance of the case.2. The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a proprietary concern engaged in the business of purchase and sale of iron scrap and\npetitioner is registered with GSTIN No. 37DJTPS3181K1ZA on the rolls of 1 st respondent. The\npetitioner has been regularly filing monthly returns and making payment of taxes as per GST Act,\n2017 after availing ITC.\n(b) While so, 1 st responden t issued a show cause notice  dated 22.06.2023 U/s 29 of SGST Act r/w\nRule 21 of CGST Rules, 2017 proposing to cancel the registration of the petitioner on the alleged\nground that the suppliers of the goods to the purchaser has availed ITC without actual receipt of\ngoods and indulged in passing on such credit to the petitioner without supply  of goods. The 1 st\nrespondent, in this regard relied on certain alleged reports allegedly received by him in respect of\nfew suppliers by the respective GST authorities. However , the petitioner was not supplied the\nreports allegedly sent by respective GST authorities of the suppliers of the petitioner . In spite of his\nobligation under law to supply all the incriminating material along with show cause notice to enable\nthe petitio ner to respond in an effective manner even the allegations levelled in the show cause\nnotice were also not correct. They are baseless and contrary to the Assessment Order .\n(c) In respons e to the show cause notice, the petitioner filed a detailed objection s dated 13.07.2023\ndisputing the allegations made in the show cause notice and requested to drop the proposed action.\nPetitioner contended that if for argume nt sake the allegations of fake invoices and claim of ITC\nwithout movement of goods as alleg ed by the 1 st respondent is admitted to be true and\nconsequently there is no purchase of goods by the petitioner , equally there cannot be any sale of\ngoods by the petitioner , inasmuch as, without inward receipt of goods, there cannot be outward sale\nof goods. Thus, if the 1 st respondent disbelieves the purchases, he should equally disbelieves the\nsales. However , without considering all these aspects, the 1 st respondent passed the impugned\norder dated 15.07.2023 cancelling the registration of the petitioner on untenable grounds and also\non the grounds whic h were not raised in the show cause notice. The impugned order is in violation\nof principles of natural justice as the alleged reports issued by the GST authorities which are the\nbasis for issuing show cause notice were not supplied to the petitioner . It is further submitted that\nsince the petitioner was not properly advised, he could not file a petition U/s 30 of CGST Act, 2017\nfor revocation of registration.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. Heard arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Redd y and learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T axes for respondents.\n4. The pivotal argument of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Reddy is that the petitioner\nnever indulged in bogus purchases or supplies to accommodate his suppliers to claim ITC fraudulently . While\nissuing show cause notice, the 1 st responden t who claims to have relied on certain reports allegedly submitted\nto him by certain GST Authorities, has not forwarded those reports to inform the petitioner with which of the\ndealers the petitioner made bogus trans actions to facilitate them to claim ITC wrongfully , so as to give an\nopportunity to the petitioner to submi t an effective reply . Learned counsel thus vehemently argued that\nprinciples of natural justice have been violated and therefore the impugned order liable to be set aside.\n5. Per contra, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes argued that the writ petition is not\nmaintainable, inasm uch as, the petitioner has alternative remedy to file a petiti on U/s 30 of APGST Act for\nrevocation of cancellation or to file an appeal against the impugned order before the Appellate Authority U/s\n107 of the APGST Act. Learned Government Pleader argued that without pursuing the alternative reliefs the\npetitioner cannot file the writ petition. Nextly , learned Government Pleader argued that the show cause notice\nis self-explanatory as the show cause notice contains the particulars of the non-existent dealers from whom\nthe petitio ner obtain ed bogus invoices and therefore the petitioner cannot claim non-supply of material and\nviolation of principles of natural justice. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow ?\n7. POINT : As can be seen, the prime conte ntion of learned Government Pleader is that since the petitioner has\nan alternat ive remedy U/s 30 of GST Act to file an application for revocation of cancellation or to assail theWASEEQimpugned order in the appeal U/s 107 of GST Act, the writ petition is not maintainable. Per contra, the\ncontention of the petitioner is that required particulars are not furnished in the show cause notice dated\n22.06.2023 and thereby principles of natural justice have been violated and therefore, the writ petition is\nmaintainable. Law is no more res-integr a with regard to the maintainability of writ petition when alternative\nremedy is available to a party . In Whirlpool Corporation  v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai  (1998) 8 SCC\n1 =MANU/SC/0664/1998, the Apex Court has observed thus:\n\"14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is\nnot limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not\nonly for issuing writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, prohibition, Qua Warranto and\nCertiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution\nbut also for \"any other purpose\".\n15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has\ndiscretion to entertain or not to enterta in a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself\ncertain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court\nwould not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been  consistently held by this\ncourt not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely , where the Writ Petition has been filed\nfor the enforcement of any of the Funda mental rights or where there has been a violation of the principle\nof natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act\nis challen ged. Ther e is a plethora of case law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic\nwhirlpool we would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they\nstill hold the field.\"\n8. Thus, Hon'ble Apex Court held that in certain contingencies viz., when writ petition is filed for enforcement\nof fundamental rights, or where there  has been a violation of principles of natural justice or when the\nproceedings impugned are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an act is challenged, the writ petition\ncould be maintainable in spite of availability of alternative remedy . In the instant case the petitioner banks\nupon the violation of principles of natur al justice to maintain the writ petition. In this context, a perusal of the\nshow cause notice dated 22.06.2023 shows that the 1 st respondent has given required particulars of the non-\nexistent tax payers from whom the petitioner allegedly obtained bogus tax invoices. Therefore, we do not find\nvenom in the conte ntion of the petitioner that the show cause notice is bereft of required particulars and\nthereby the principles of natural justice  were violated. Admittedly , the petitio ner has alternative remedy to\nchallenge the impugned order which he did not avail. Therefore, we does not deserve any order in the writ\npetition. However , considering that the petitioner's registration has been cancelled and thereby he cannot\ncontinue his business activities, we deem  it apposite to give an opportunity to the petitioner to challenge the\nimpugned order either by way of filing a petition U/s 30 of the GST Act or to file an appeal within a\nreasonable time.\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is dismissed. However , giving an opportunity to the petitioner either to file an\napplication U/s 30 of the GST Act for revocation of cancellation, or to challeng e the impugned order by way\nof filing an appeal and the petitioner can avail either remedy within 15 days from the date of receipt of a copy\nof this order , in which case the concerne d authority shall pass an appropriate order on merits after affording an\nopportunity of hearing to both parties. No costs.\n10. As a sequel, interlocutory applications if any pending, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The petitioner is a private company in the business of executing works contracts. The petitioner executed\nGovernment works as a Sub-Contractor . The principal Contractor M/s.Stanch Projects Private Limited has not\nmade the payments to the petitioner for the works executed on the premise that the State Government has not\nreleased the payments to the principal contractor( s).\n3. The petitioner is due by an amount of Rs.1,77,12,294/- towards arrears of tax for the period ending March,\n2023. The petitioner could not pay the taxes as the petitioner did not receiv e the payments due from the\nprincipal contractor .\n4. It is also submitted that the principal contractor has filed writ petition challenging the in-action on the part\nof the Government in releasing the bills payable. In the meanwhile, the 1st responde nt issued garnishee\nnotices dated 19.10.2023 and 28.10.2023 to the principal contractor for realization of the tax dues.\n5. The petitioner filed WP .No.31777 of 2023 and this Court passed the following order on 1 1.12.2023.\n9. Hence,  in these circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that the instant set of facts are\nrequired to be adjudicated equitably and without transgressing the four corners of GST Act.10. In that view of the matter , we deem it appropriate to modify the garnishee order passed by the\nrespondents by restricting it, in so far as it relates to the amounts in the case of the garnishee namely M/s.\nStanch Projects Private Limited. In so far as garnishee order passed by the respondents in respect of the\nother three garnishees, the same are set aside.\n11. In any event, this order shall not be treated as a bar on the respondents from seeking payment of tax\ndues from  the petitioner , in the event of the petitioner receiving his dues from either of the three\ncontractors or all of them. In the event of the petitioner receiving his dues from any of the contractors, the\npetitioner shall deposit tax dues within a period of two weeks thereafter . In the event of such deposit, the\nrespondents shall withdraw the garnishee notice as against M/s. Stanch Projects Private Limited.\n6. It is subm itted that, the petitioner is due to receive bills to the tune of Rs.9, 62, 21, 616/- from the principal\ncontractors. An amount of Rs.23, 00, 000/- was credited to the account of the petitioner from a third party\nwhich was promptly adjusted by the bank itself, towards the dues payable to the bank, i.e, towards the arrears\nof the over draft account. The 1st respondent issued a notice dated 18.01 .2024 calling upon the petitioner to\npay an amount of Rs.23,00,000/- within a period of one week. The petitioner submitted his explanation to the\n1st responden t that the amount which was credited into their account was auto debited and adjusted by their\nbanker towards the arrears of the over draft account.\n7. The 1st respondent issued a notice dated 25.01.2024 calling upon the bank to pay the total amount of\nRs.1,77,12,294/- and to pay the arrears as and when amounts are credited to the account of the petitioner . In\nthe said notice, the 1st responden t called upon the bank to make the payment of Rs.23, 00, 000/- which was\ncredited to the account of the petitioner .\n8. The petitioner subm its that, 1st respondent is not allowing the petitioner to utilize any part of the amount\nreceived in the bank account which is resulting in scuttling the operations of the petitioner . The\ncorrespondence of the 1st respondent with the bank resulted in freezing of the account of the petitioner .\n9. The petitioner filed WP.No.3407 of 2024 seeking raising of the attachment of the bank account of the\npetitioner and consequential other reliefs. The writ petition was disposed off by this Court vide order dated\n09.02.2024 permitting the petitioner to make a representation to the 1st respondent placing cogent reasons for\nseeking time and the said representation be considered and suitable orders be passed after affording an\nopportunity of hearing to the petitioner .\n10. It is submitted that, the petitioner has submitted a representation on 19.02.2024 and sought six months\ntime for making the due payments. The 1st respondent has summarily rejected the plea of the petitioner vide\nendorsement dated 1 1.03.2024. The said proceedings is under challenge before this Court.\n11. The learned Govern ment Pleader for Commercial Tax submits that the case of the petitioner is not unique\nand that there are several contractors in the state, similarly executing works contractors, however they had\ncomplied with their statutory tax payments. It is also submitted that the petitioner is not inclined to pay the tax\narrears. At the same time would not deny the liability of the state to pay the dues to the Contractors. It is\nsubmitted that the petitioner has not deposited an amount of Rs.23,00,000/-which was credited into the\naccount by one of the principal contractor .\n12. A specific query was posed by this Court to the learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes to\nascertain whether the amount of Rs.23 ,00,000/-, which was deposited in the account of the petitioner was\nadjusted by the banker towards the arrears of the over draft account. The learned Government Pleader on\ninstructions submits that the amount deposited into the account of the petitioner was adjusted by the banker .\n13. It is not disputed that the petitioner is due to receive payment from the principa l contractors for the works\nexecuted. It is also not in dispute that the petitioner has executed works for the Government agencies. It is also\nnot in dispute that the principal contractor has initiated legal steps for recovery of the dues from the\nGovernment.\n14. The petiti oner is not denying or disputin g the tax arrears. The petitioner is admi tting the dues, however , he\nis requesting for grant of installments for dischar ging the arrears of tax. This Court in WP.No.3407 of 2024\nhad permitted the petitioner to make a representation seeking appropriate extension of time for payment of tax\narrears. The 1st respondent ought to have exhibited a more pragmatic approach in considering the request of\nthe petitioner .15. The 1st respondent ought to have before passing the endorsement dated 11.03.2024 considered the case of\nthe petitioner purely on the facts presented by the petitioner .\n16. There is force in the contention of the petitioner that a blanket attachment of the bank account of the\npetitioner - company would bring the operations of the company to a grinding halt. The company would\ndefault in paying the salaries and other operational dues. As per Section 80 of GST Act, the Commissioner\nmay, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the time for payment or allow  payment of any amount due\nunder this Act in monthly instalments not exceeding twenty four .\n17. The learned counse l for the petitioner requests the Court to consider granting six months time to repay the\ntax arrears. The learned Government Pleader for Taxes submits that the department is more concerned in\nrecovery of the arrears and nothing else.\n18. In our considered opinion, ends of justice would be met if the petitioner is perm itted to pay the tax arrears\nin six monthly installments starting from 15th April, 2024 and ending 15th September , 2024.\n19. The impugned proceedings dated 11.03.2024 are hereby set aside, further the Form GST DRC.13 dated\n25.01.2024 issued by the 1st respondent to the petitioner's banker Canara Bank SME, Kukatpally Branch,\nHyderabad is also set aside. It is made clear that the petitioner shall repay the tax arrears in terms of the above\nobservations of this Court.\n20. In the result, the writ petition is disposed of f. No costs.\n21.

The Prosecution's case, as presented in the report dated 24.02.2024 and outlined in the counter -affidavits\nsubmitted on behalf of the respondentState in four petitions, is as follows:\ni. Based on the report dated 24.02.2024  from the Deputy Director of the Andhra Pradesh State\nDirectorate of Revenue Intelligence (A.P.S.D.R.I.) to Station House Officer, Machavaram Police\nStation in Vijayawa da, a crime had been registered in Crime No.63 of 2024.

Additionally , a Show Cause-cum-\nDemand Notice had been issued by the D.G.G.I., proposing a penalty of approximately Rs.16\nCrores under the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax (C.G.S.T .) Act, 2017, for the\nirregular availment of I.T .C.\niii. M/s. A vexa Corporation Private Limited (A.C.P .L.) in Andhra Pradesh has wrongly or illegitimately\nclaimed Input Tax Credit (I.T.C.) based  on invoices despite not receiving the associated services\nfrom July 2017 to March 2022. Moreover , it is acknowledged that they transferr ed these irregularly\nclaimed I.T.C. amou nts to various entities without providing any services during the mentioned\nperiod. Based on the admission of A.2, it appears that they intentionally misrepresented facts in\ntheir GSTR3B returns by indicating receipt of services when, in fact, they had not received them.\niv. Explanation 2 of Section 74 of the Central Goods and Services Tax (C.G.S.T .) Act 2017 defines\n\"suppression\" as the act of not disclosing facts or information that a taxable person is obligated to\ndeclare in returns, statements, reports, or any other documents as required under the Act or the rules\nestablished therein. It also includes the failure to provide information when requested in writing by\nthe prope r officer. M/s. Avexa Corpo ration Private Limited (A.C.P .L.) has fraudulently and\nimproperly claimed inadmissible Input Tax Credit (I.T.C.), intentionally misrep resented facts, and\nsuppressed information. Consequently , they have violated the C.G.S.T . Act, 2017 provisions and\nthe rules framed thereunder .\nv. Kurra Jogeswara Rao, who is arrayed as A.2 in this case, confessed in his voluntary statements\ndated 22.07.2022 that he is the authorized individual representing M/s. Avexa Corporation Private\nLimited (A.C.P .L.) is accountable for all business operations, tax affairs, and lawful and unlawful\nactions pertaining to the company . Upon scrutiny of the seized documents and statements provided\nby A.2, it was found that M/s. A.C.P .L. had wrongfully availed and utilized an irregular Input Tax\nCredit (I.T.C.) amounting to Rs. 2,62,56,750/-. Consequently , this amount is subject to recovery\nunder Section 74 of the C.G.S.T . Act.\nvi. Furthermore, M/s. Avexa Corporation Private Limited (A.C.P .L.) has also wrongly claimed Input\nTax Credit (I.T.C.) amounting to Rs.5,39,57,910/- without receiving corresponding goods or\nservices. They are consequently liable for a penalty of Rs.3,39,77,220/- as per Section 122(1)( vii)\nof the C.G.S.T . Act, read in conjunction with Section 20 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax(I.G.S.T .) Act, 2017. Additionally , M/s. A.C.P .L. has transferred irreg ular I.T.C. worth\nRs.8,04,63,898/- without providing goods or services. For this action, they are subject to a penalty\nof Rs. 3,57,43,817/- as per Section 122(1)( ii) of the C.G.S.T . Act.\nvii. The inves tigation conducted by the Directorate General of Goods and Servic es Tax Intelligence\n(D.G.G.I.), Hyderabad unit, unveiled that M/s. Avexa Corporation Private Limit ed (A.C.P .L.) solely\nreceived invoices and bills from four firms/companies, namely (1) M/s. Tanisha Infra Zone Pvt.\nLtd. (2) M/s. Rollon  Projects (3) M/s. Annai Infra Developers Ltd. (4) M/s. Allw ays Town Planners\nPvt. Ltd. However , A.C.P.L. did not receive either goods or services from these entities. The Show\nCause Notice indicated that Rs. 22 Crores was transferred to these four firms, resulting in the\nirregular claiming of Input Tax Credit (I.T.C.) amounting to Rs. 2.63 Crores. Since A.C.P .L. did not\nreceive services from its subcontractors (the four firms mentioned above), they couldn't provide\nsuch subcontracted work to M/s. Jakson Eminence Pvt. Ltd. It appears that an amount of Rs.\n21,93,08,317/- was improperly diverted by A.C.P .L. without receiving any goods or services, and\nall four of the listed firms/companies were implicated in misappropriating government funds.\nviii. Furthermore, M/s. Avexa Corporation Private Limited (A.C.P .L.) received a work order dated\n27.10.2017 for the construction of the \"N9 Road Near Uddandarayunipalem  to Nidamarru in\nAmaravathi\" on a subcontract basis from M/s. B.S.R. Infratech India Pvt. Ltd. The investigation\nuncovered that A.C.P .L. diverted funds to four fictitious entities, namely (1) M/s. Khwahish\nMarketing Pvt. Ltd. (2) M/s. Noida Ispat India Limited (3) M/s. Prasant Indust rial Corporation (4)\nM/s. Goldphoenix Iron and Steels Pvt. Ltd. A.C.P .L. issued outward invoices to M/s. B.S.R.\nInfratech India Pvt. Ltd. with a taxab le value of Rs. 23,43,92,315/- along with G.S.T . of Rs.\n2,81,27,078/-. This implies that A.C.P .L. received a total amount of Rs. 26,25, 19,393/- from M/s.\nBSR Infratech India Pvt. Ltd., the principal contractor .\nix. Additionally , accord ing to the Show Cause Notice issued by the Directorate General of Goods and\nServices Tax Intelli gence (D.G.G.I.), A.V.E.X.A. was involved in inward bill trading with four\nfirms namely (1) Aadhya Enterprises (2) Sanjay Kumar Bhatia (3) Tanishq Steels Limited (4)\nMount Business Build Pvt. Ltd. As a result of this activity , A.V.E.X.A. irregular ly claimed input tax\ncredit amounting to Rs.2,69,21,955/-. The total value of these fictitious input supplies was\nRs.15,16,39,909/-.\n5. The case of the Petitioners/A.4 and A.5 in Crl.P .No.1448 of 2024 and the Petitioners/A.2 and A.3 in\nCrl.P .No.1449 of 2024, are the same, in brief, are that:\ni. The entire complaint is built upon fabricated and distorted facts, completely untrue and utterly\nfallacious. It is driven solely by politic al vendetta against the Petitioners/accused. The purported\ntransactions allegedly occurred between 2017 and 2022; however , the Petitioners had already\nceased associating with A.V.E.X.A. company in 2011 and 2015. Therefore, these allegations are\nfictitious and have been concocted with the malicious intent to prosecute the Petitioners unjustly .\nii. Furthermore, it is contended that to establish the elements of Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code\n(I.P.C.), there must be dishonest induc ement leading to the delivery of property to the accused\nthrough deceit, whic h is conspicuously lacking in the current matter . The authorities responsible for\nentrusting the work expressed contentm ent with the work performed by the principal contractor ,\nB.S.R.I.I.P .L. Notably , B.S.R.I.I.P .L. did not raise any grievances of deceit or cheating against\nA.V.E.X.A.\niii. Furthermore, it is argued that to fulfil the requirements outlined in Section 409 of the Indian Penal\nCode (I.P.C.), the accused must belong to specific professions such as public servant, banker ,\nmerchant, factor , broker , attorney , or agent. Therefore, as the Petitioners do not belong to any of the\ncategories as mentioned above, they do not meet the criteria set forth under Section 409 of the\nI.P.C.\niv. The provisions of Section 30 of the I.P.C. are not applicable in this case, as the alleged invoices do\nnot represent any form of valuable security . Additionally , the accusation of forgery has not been\nraised by any indivi dual or entity whose  invoices are purported to have been forged. Therefore, the\nelements required under Section 30 of the I.P .C. are not satisfied in this scenario.v. The theory of conspiracy presented by the complainant seems to be a fabrication aimed at\npolitically targeting the Petitioners' husband and brother -in-law (A.4 and A.5). It's implied that this\nmove stem s from their outspoken opposition to individuals in influential positions within the\ncurrent administration. However , there is a noticeable absence of prima facie  evidence\nsubstantiating the alleged offences, casting doubt on the genuine intentions or bona fides behind the\ncomplaint.\nvi. The initiation of the current criminal proceedings appears to be a deliberate attempt to hinder the\nactive participation of the Petitioners' family in the upcoming General Elections of 2024, with a\npotential motive to undermine their political involvement through legal means.\n6. The case of the Petitioners in Crl.P .No.1489 of 2024, in brief, is that:\ni. The allegations outlined in the F.I.R. or complaint are deemed to be incredibly far-fetched and\ninherently improbable. They lack the substance necessary for any prudent indiv idual to arrive at a\nreasonable conclusi on that there are sufficient grounds for initiating proceedings against the\nPetitioners. Merely citing sections of the law and subjecting the Petitioners to trial under such\ncircumstances would constitute nothing short of an abuse of the Court's process.\nii. The assertion that the 1st Petitioner in Crl.P .No.1489 of 2024, who holds a position in the\nGovernment as a Minister from Guntur District (referred to as A.1), exerts substantial influence\nover contractors conducting projects in the Guntur District, particularly within the Andhra Pradesh\nCapital Region Development Authority (A.P.C.R.D.A.), lacks clarity and supporting evidence.\nThese claims appear vague and unsupported, thereby casting doubt on their validity and credibility .\niii. The first Petitioner in Crl.P .No.1489 of 2024 has been announced as a contesting candidate\nrepresenting the Telugu Desam Party for the Chilakaluripeta Assembly Consti tuency in the 2024\nGeneral Election. Additionally , he holds the responsibility assigned by the party as the Zonal\nInchar ge for East and West Godavari Districts. He coordinates the leadership and cadre throughout\nthese districts for the forthcoming General Elections. There is a concern regarding the potential\narrest of the Petitioners under the pretext of being former directors of the mentioned company .\n7. The case of the Petitioners in Crl.P .No.1539 of 2024, in brief, is that:\ni. The offences outlined in the G.S.T . Act address the use of false, forged, or fake documents and the\noffence of abetment , with specific provisions and corresponding punishments. Consequently , it is\ncontended that the police lack jurisdict ion to register an F.I.R. under Chapter XVII of the I.P.C.\nprovisions, which stipulate punishments exceeding those prescribed under the G.S.T . Act.\nii. The Petitioner is a well-established company engaged in construction activities and has undertaken\ngovernment projects  across multiple states. At no point in its operations has the Petitioner been\nassociated with irregularities or offences. Specifically , the Petitioner contracted work from\nM/s.A vexa consistently fulfilled its financial obligations, including the payment of G.S.T . The\nallegations presented in the F.I.R. and the evidence collected fail to demonstrate any wrongdoing by\nthe Petitioner .\n8. I have heard both sides. Both parties reaffirmed their arguments, aligning with the contentions outlined in\nthe petitions and their respective counters.\n9. In Bhadr esh Bipinbhai Sheth  v. State of Gujarat  (2016) 1 SCC 152, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid\ndown specific guidelines for applications for anticipatory bail. In paragraph 25.10, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nheld as under:\n\"25.10. We all also reproduce para 112 of the judgment in the Siddaram Satingappa case, where the Court\ndelineated the following factors and parameters that need to be taken into consideration while dealing\nwith anticipatory bail:\n(a) The nature and gravity of the accusation and the exact role of the accused must be properly\ncomprehended before arrest is made;\n(b) The antecedents of the applicant, including the fact as to whether the accused has previously\nunder gone imprisonment on conviction by a Court in respect of any cognizable of fence;(c) The possibility of the applicant of fleeing from justice;\n(d) The possibility of the accused's likelihood to repeat similar or other of fence;\n(e) Where the accusatio ns have been made only with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant\nby arresting them;\n(f) Impact of grant of anticipatory bail, particularly in cases of large magnitude affecting a vast number\nof people;\n(g) The Courts must carefully evaluate the available material against the accused. The Court must also\nclearly comprehend the exact role of the accused in the case. The cases in which the accused is\nimplicated with the help of Sections 34 and 149 of the Penal Code, 1860, the Court should consider\nwith even greater care and caution because over-implication in the case is a matter of common\nknowledge and concern;\n(h) While considering the prayer for the grant of anticipatory bail, a balance has to be struck between\ntwo factors, namely , no prejudice should be caused to a free, fair and complet e investigation, and\nthere should be prevention of harassment, humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused;\n(i) The Court should consider reasonable apprehension of tampering of the witness or apprehension of\nthreat to the complainant.\n(j) Frivolity in Prosecut ion should always be considered, and it is only the element of genuineness that\nshall have  to be considered in the matter  of grant of bail and in the event of there being some doubt\nas to the genuineness of the Prosecution, in the normal course of events, the accused is entitled to\nan order of bail,\"\n10. In Shri Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia and Others  v. State of Punjab  (1980) 2 Supreme Court Cases 565, the\nHon'ble Apex Court held that \"The question whether to grant bail or not depends for its answers upon a\nvariety of circumstances, the cumulative ef fect of which must enter into the judicial verdict\".\n11. In Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetr e v. State of Maharashtra  (2011) 1 SCC 694. The Hon'ble Apex Court\nlaid down certain factors and parameters to consider while dealing with anticipatory bail. It further held as\nfollows:\n113. Arrest should be the last option, and it should be restricted to those exceptional cases where\narresting the accused is imperative based on the facts and circumstances of that case. The Court\nmust caref ully exam ine the entire availa ble record, particularly the allegations directly attributed to\nthe accused, corroborated by other material and circumstances on record.\n12. The powe r to authorize detention is a very solemn function. It affects the liberty and freedom of citizens\nand needs to be exercised with great care and caution. The attitude of arresting first and then proceeding with\nthe rest is despicable. It has become a handy tool for police officers who lack sensitivity or act with oblique\nmotives.\n13. The law presumes an accused to be innocent until his guilt is proven. As a presu mably innocent person, he\nis entitled to all the fundamental rights, including the right of liberty , guaranteed under Article 21 of the\nConstitution of India.\n14. It is settle d law that while considering the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail, the accusation's nature and\ngravity and the accused's exact role must be properly comprehended before arrest is made. In the event of\nsome doub t as to the genuineness of the Prosecution, the normal course of event s is that the accused is entitled\nto an order of anticipatory bail. The Court must adequately exercise its jurisdiction to protect the personal\nliberty of a citizen. It is also a well-accepted principle that bail is the rule and the jail is the exception.\n15. It could be seen from the record that 2nd respondent/Defacto  Complainant, holding the position of Deputy\nDirector , Andhra Pradesh State Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, lodged a\nwritten complaint with the 1st Resp ondent/Station House Officer, Machavaram P.S., and 1st Respondent\ninitiated the legal process by registering F.I.R. No.63 of 2024, dated 25.02.2024 for the offences punishable\nunder sections 420, 409, 467, 471, 477A, 120B r/w 34 of I.P .C.16. As per the complaint, Petitioners in Crl.M.P .No.1449 of 2024/A.2 and A.3 are the present Directors of\nAvexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd (A.V .E.X.A. formerly known as M/s Siva Swathi Constructions Pvt. Ltd.);\nAllegations suggest that A.1, in collaboration with the other named accused, engaged in a series of unethical\nmanoeuvres. These included submitting  falsified documents to government authorities, thereby perpetrating\nfinancial fraud and inflicting a substantial loss totalling Rs.26,25,19,393/- upon the Government exchequer .\nThe purported misdeeds extend to the diversion of funds entrusted by the Government for executing\ndevelopmental proje cts, constituting a grave economic offence. These fraudu lent activities are reported to\nhave occurred between 2017 and 2022 with the collective conscience of all the Directors of the accused\ncompany being a company colluded with several other companies to deal with infrastructure, handling\nimportant projects, and dealing with Government functionaries, breached the trust reposed on it and\ncommitted criminal breach of trust and caused huge loss to the state exchequer .\n17. The learned counsel for the Petitioners/A.2 and A.3 in Crl.M.P .No.1449 of 2024 contends that the\nallegations outlined in the written complaint are vague, omnibus, false, uncontroverted and absurd and are\nonly created to implicate the Petitioners as a result of political motives. They do not reveal any offence by the\nPetitioners. The essential elements required under Section 420 of IPC are not present in the current case. They\nargue that no deceitful inducement prompted the delivery of property to the accused parties, a crucial aspect\nfor the application of this section. Additionally , they assert that the complaint lacks any indication of breach of\ntrust necessary to invoke Section 409 of IPC, as there was no formal entrustment of property to the\nPetitioners. Furthermore, the Petitioners highlight that the authorities responsible for overseeing the work\nexpressed satisfaction with the performance of the principal contractor , B.S.R.I.I.P .L. Moreover ,\nB.S.R.I.I.P .L., as the principal contractor , did not raise any grievances regarding the non-completion of work\nby A vexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd.\n18. Accordin g to the A.2 and A.3, their association with the company began when they assumed roles as\nDirector and Additional Director in 2015 and 2020, respectively . A.3's involve ment with Avexa Corporation\nPvt. Ltd. commenced following the unfortunate passing of her late husband, Sri Boggavarapu Markhandeyulu\n(A.6), who held a directorial position at the time of his demise. Subsequently , A.3 was appointed as the\nAdditional Director of the company . Since her appointment in 2020, A.3 has maintained a non-participatory\nstance in the day-to-day operations of A vexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd.\n19. In Crl.P .No.1539 of 2024, the first Petitioner is represented as B.S.R. Infratech India Limited through its\nManaging Director , Balusu Srinivasa Rao. The second Petitioner is Balusu Srinivasa Rao.\n20. The Petitioners in Crl.P .No.1539 of 2024 assert that the first Petitioner , a reputable construction company ,\nhas a well-established presence in the construction industry , undertaking govern ment projects across multiple\nstates such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. Specifically , concerning\nconstructing the 'N9 Road' in Amaravati , authorities have expressed satisfaction with the completed work and\naccompanying test reports. Consequently , they approved the M.Book and released payments for the\ncompleted tasks. Furthermore, the first Petitioner engaged in M/s. Avexa services for certain aspects of the\nproject and promptly settled all dues, including the Goods and Services Tax (G.S.T .); however , despite the\npayments made by the first Petitioner to Avexa, the G.S.T . amount owed to the first Petitioner by M/s.\nAmaravati Development Corporation remains outstanding. The Petitioners emphasize that any irregularities\nrelated to Input Tax Credit (I.T.C.) are solely attributable to M/s. Avexa and its Directors, not to the first\nPetitioner . They argue that if there were any discrepancies in the availing of I.T.C., they should not be\nassociated with the first Petitioner's operations or conduct.\n21. The available records show that the Petitioners (in Crl.P .No.1539 of 2024) initiated legal action by filing\nWrit Petiti on No.5660 of 2024 before this Court. Their petition sought a declaration that the actions of the\nRespondents, involv ing interference with the Petitioners' office, threats to seal the premises, and removal of\nstaff without adhering to due process of law, were unlawful and arbitrary . During the proceedings, the learned\nGovernment Pleade r for Home repres enting the Respondents in the Writ Petition presented arguments\nindicating a complaint lodged concerning G.S.T . affairs, which prompted an investigation by the concerned\npolice authorities. As a result, the premises of the Petitioner Company were subject to search as part of the\nongoing inquiry . Subsequently , the Court disposed of the Writ Petition at the admission stage, issuing\ndirectives to the Respondents; specifically , they were instructed not to interfere with the Petitioners' office or\ntheir employees without adhering to due process of law .\n22. The Petitioners (in Crl.P .No.1539 of 2024) argue that the remand report of A.1 includes an allegation\nsuggesting collusion between the first Petitioner's company and M/s. Avexa. They contend that this allegationis maliciously fabricated to harass the Petitioners to satisfy political vendettas. Importantly , they highlight that\nover the past five years, there have been no allegations against the Petitioners' work in any capacity .\nAdditionally , they emphasize that the first Petitioner has diligently cleared all tax and G.S.T . liabilities despite\nthe Government failing to specify the exact G.S.T . amount in question.\n23. It is the Prosecution's case that while A.1 was acting as Additional Director of M/s.A vexa Company , a\nsub-contractor , an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- was transferred from M/s. B.S.R. Infra Tech, who was an original\ncontractor to the Government illegally on 31.01.2020. Abusing the position and influence of his father , A.1\nentered into a consp iracy with the companies with a common intention of misap propriating funds which were\nentrusted to carry out the earmarked work contracts at Amaravati region, created false documents as if certain\nsupplies or services were rendered by filing false invoices without actually doing no such work and diverted\nhuge Government amounts to the companies by using false documents as genuine and by creating false G.S.T .\naccounts and claimed Input T ax Credit to a tune of Rs.8,00,00,000/-.\n24. The learned Special Public Prosecutor contends that D.G.G.I., Hyderabad's investigation is confined to\ndetermining the evasion of input tax credit by the A.V.E.X.A. company and issued a show cause notice for the\npayment of Rs.16/- crores as a penalty under section 74(1) of the provisions of the C.G.S.T . Act, 2017; the\ninvestigation done by D.G.G.I., Hydera bad unit established that M/s. Avexa company is in conspiracy with\nshell companies, created fake invoices, and committed misappropriation of tax amount to Rs.16,06,78,558/-.\n25. It is not in dispute that M/s Avexa received a work order dated 27.10.2017 from M/s B.S.R. Infratech\nPrivate Limited on a subcontract basis  for the construction of the N9 road from Uddandurayunipalem to\nNidamarru in Amaravati.\n26. The learned Specia l Public Prosecutor contends that the investigation revealed that Avexa had issued\noutward invoices having a taxable value of Rs.23,43,92,315/- along with G.S.T . of Rs.2,81,27,078/- to M/s.\nB.S.R. Infratech India Private Limited implies that Avexa received Rs.26,25,1 9,393/-from B.S.R. Infratech\nPrivate Limited, the principal contractor and as per the investigation, M/s. Avexa has transferred funds to fake\nentities outside the state of Andhra Pradesh, and Avexa only received inward bills/invoices without receipt of\nGoods/Services from them.\n27. It is not in dispute that Avexa has receiv ed a work order regarding the construction of roads and utilities in\nthe green buffer of N6 road in Amaravati Capital City from M/s. Jakson Eminence for values of\nRs.19,49,94,000/- and Rs.35,85,95,506/ - dated 28.02.2019, the above-said work was claimed to have been\nsub-contracted by Avexa to M/s. Tanisha  Infra XZone Private Limited, M/s. Rollon Projects, M/s. Annai Infra\nDevelopers Limited and M/s. Allways T own Planners Private Limited.\n28. The learn ed Special Public Prosecutor further contends that Avexa had diverted substantial public money ,\ni.e., Rs.17,85, 61,864/- from the M/s. Aditya Enterprises, M/s. Sanjay Kumar Bhatia, M/s. Tanishq Steels\nLimited and M/s. Mount Business Build Private Limited: several sub-contracts were entered into without the\npermission of Amaravati Development Corporation Limited (A.D.C.L.), a Government body; the subcontract\nbetween B.S.R. and Avexa does not have prior approval of the authority mentioned above, violating the terms\nof the contract, there were invoices issued and transfer of funds were carried out by the Respondent in colour\nof carrying out of works, whereas there was no supply of any goods and services by the Respondents; hence,\nstating that there is a diversion of funds. So, the diversion of Government funds by the Avexa through the\nshell companies has to be investigated.\n29. Sri B. Adinarayana Rao learned senior counsel representing the Petitioners submits that the parties are\nprivate entities and there is no contractual relationship with the Government; there is no privity of contract\nbetween the B.S.R. (Principal) and the Government, hence, the case again st the cannot be upheld; the\nexecution of work is already done, and therefore, there is no question of diversion of funds, as the funds are\nall utilized towards the works; the claim of investigating agency stating that execution of work nonetheless is\nof no relevance at this stage of the case cannot be upheld; any concerned case against the Respondent is to be\ncarried out by the G.S.T . authorities, as the orders are not granted yet in relevanc e to irregular input tax credits\nand the present allegations cannot be proved by the Respondent/State.\n30. He furthe r contends  that section 132 of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to\nas 'the Act') provides punishment for certain offences.- Whoever commits, or causes to commit and retain the\nbenefits arising out of, any of the following of fences, namely:\n(a) supplies any goods or services or both without the issue of any invoice, in violation of theprovisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder , to evade tax;\n(b) issues any invoice or bill without supply  of goods or services or both in violation of the provisions\nof this Act, or the rules made thereunder leading to wrongful availment or utilisation of input tax\ncredit or refund of tax;\n31. He further contend s by relying on section 134 of the Act, Cognizance of Offences.- No court shall take\ncognizance of any offence punishable under this Act or the rules made thereunder except with the previous\nsanction of the Com missioner , and no court inferior to that of a Magistrate of the First Class shall try any such\noffence.\n32. He further contends by relying on section 137 of the Act, Of fences by companies.-\n(1) Where an offence committed by a person under this Act is a company , every person who, at the\ntime the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the\nconduct of the business of the company , as well as the company , shall be deeme d to be guilty of the\noffence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly .\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where an offence unde r this Act has been\ncommitted by a company and it is prove d that the offence has been committed with the consent or\nconnivance of or is attributable to any negligence on the part of, any director , manager , secretary or\nanother officer of the company , such director , manager , secretary or other officer shall also be\ndeemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished\naccordingly .\n(3) Where an offence under this Act has been committed by a taxable person being a partnership firm\nor a Limit ed Liabili ty Partnership or a Hindu Undivided Family or a trust, the partner or karta or\nmanaging trustee shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded\nagainst and punishe d accordingly and the provisions of subsection (2) shall, mutatis mutandis,\napply to such persons.\n(4) Nothing contained in this section shall render any such person liable to any punishment provided in\nthis Act if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he had exercised\nall due diligence to prevent the commission of such of fence.\n33. The contention put forth by the Petitioners in Crl.P .No.1489 of 2024 is that the 1st Petitioner has been an\nactive member of the Telugu Desam Party for over three decades, with a notabl e political career that includes\nmultiple terms as a member of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly , spanning from 1999 to 2019. From\n2014 to 2019, the 1st Petitioner held significant ministerial portfolios, including Agriculture, Agriculture\nProcessing, Marketi ng and Warehousing, Animal Husbandry , Dairy Developm ent, Fisheries, Food and Civil\nSupplies, and Price-Monitoring and Consumer Affairs. Moreover , the 2nd Petitioner , the daug hter of the 1st\nPetitioner , expresse s apprehension regarding the possibility of imminent arrest in connection with F.I.R.\nNo.63 of 2024, dated 25.02.2024. Notably , the 1st Petitioner's son is arrayed as A.1 in the F.I.R. as mentioned\nabove and was consequently apprehend ed on 29.02.2024. Additionally , it is contended that the 2nd Petitioner\nin Crl.P.No.1489 of 2024 has never held the position of Director within Avexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd. at any\npoint.\n34. It is also contende d on behalf of the Petitioners in Crl.P .No.1489 of 2024 that even according to the\ncomplaint itself, both A.1, the son of the first Petitioner , and the first Petitio ner were merely Directors of\nAvexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd., with no active involvement beyond their directorial roles. Moreover , the\nProsecution's case indicates that the alleged fraudulent activities transpired between 2017 and 2022 with the\ncollective awarenes s of all directors of the accused company . The contentions raised by the Petitioners in\nCrl.P .No.1489 of 2024 highlight that the first Petitioner disengaged from Avexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd. as early\nas 2010, while the second Petitioner never held any role within the company . Remarkably , these assertions\nremain uncontested, with no prima facie  evidence disputing the Petitioners' claims. The Petitioners in\nCrl.P .No.1489 of 2024 express genuine  concerns regarding potential arrest, citing their familial ties to the\nindividuals named as accused in the F.I.R. Nevertheless, they assert that no prima facie  material has been\npresented to implicate them in the company's affairs during the period of alleged fraudulent activities from\n2017 to 2022.35. The status of the first Petitioner (in Crl. M.P. No.1489 of 2024), a former cabinet Minister aged 66, who\nintends to contest in the upcoming elections for the Chilakaluripeta Assembly constituency , remains\nuncontested.\n36. Accordin g to the Prosecution's case, the alleged fraudulent activities occurre d between 2017 and 2022\nwith the collective awareness of all directors of the accused company . In Crl.P .No.1448 of 2024, the\nPetitioners, A.4 and A.5, assert that they were previously directors of Avexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd. (formerly\nknown as M/s Siva Swathi Constructions Pvt. Ltd.) and exited from the company in 2011 and 2015,\nrespectively . This fact remains undisputed, as no prima facie  material has been presented to challenge it. The\ncontention of the Petitioners in Crl.P .No.1448 of 2024 is that they harbor genuin e concerns regarding potential\narrest on the pretext of being former directors of Avexa Corporation Pvt. Ltd. This apprehension is further\nheightened by the arrest of A.1, who is the son and son-in-law of the Petitioners 1 and 2, respectively , and was\nalso a former director of the company . Importantly , no material has been provided to demonstrate the\ninvolvement of the Petitioners in the company's affairs during the period of alleged fraudulent activities from\n2017 to 2022. This lack of substantiatio n underscores the Petitioners' contention of being unjustly targeted to\nimpede their family's active participation in the forthcoming general elections in 2024.\n37. The first Petitioner (in Crl.P .No.1448 of 2024), a woman aged 64 years, and the other Petitioners, have\nexpressed their willingness to comply with any conditions set forth by the Court and to cooperate fully with\nthe investigation.\n38. As seen from the record, the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (D.G.G.I.) had\npreviously investiga ted the submission of counterfeit invoice bills by the shell companies associated with the\nfirm. These entities purportedly claime d to be engaged in development activities in the Amaravati region,\nalthough no actual work transpired. Consequently , the D.G.G.I. recommended a penalty of Rs.16 crores\nagainst A.1's company under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. This indicates that the D.G.G.I.,\nHyderabad, has undertaken a significant portion of the investigation.\n39. This is evident from the committee's comprehensive report regarding the allegations against M/s. Avexa\nCorporation Private Limited by A.P.S.D.R.I., Vijayawada; the matter originated from a letter sent by the\nSpecial Commissioner of A.P.S.D.R.I., Vijayawada, to the Special Chief Secretary , Finance (DP-I)\nDepartment. The Special Commissioner requested the forwarding of the letter to the Special Chief Secretary ,\nMA & U.D., for further action. In response, the Commissioner of A.P.C.R.D.A. constituted a committee\ncomprised of Chief Engineers from APCRDA/ADCL through Rc.No. 23/24-Estt., dated 08.02.2024, to\ninvestigate the purported diversion of funds by M/s. Avexa Corporation Private Limited. The committee\nmembers include:\ni. Sri N.V .R.K.Prasad, Chief Engineer , H&B\nii. Sri P.Siva Prasada Raju, SE/Chief Engineer (F AC)\niii. Sri G.V .Pallam Raju, SE/Chief Engineer (F .A.C.), T&T\n40. It is observed in the report that as per note of APSDRI/DGGI, dated 06.07.202 3, in Para (11), the central\nallegation of diversion of public funds by M/s. Avexa Corporation Private Limited, Vizianagaram, A.P., to the\nextent of Rs.45.37 Crores, is resorting to inward and outward bill trading. After having examined all the\navailable records with A.D.C.L. (Amaravati Development Corporation, V ijayawada), it is concluded that there\nis no agreement between A.D.C.L. and M/s. Avexa Corporation Private Limited, the total mobilization\nadvance was paid to M/s. B.S.R.I.I.L. is Rs.20.80 crores. The total bill amount paid to the Principal\nContractor , i.e., M/s. B.S.R.I.I.L. is Rs.118.82 crores,  and the G.S.T . Component Paid & released to the\nPrincipal contractor  is Rs.5,18,10,138/-. Hence, the allegation has not been substantiated per A.D.C.L.'s\navailable records.\n41. It is also observed in the report that after verifying all the existing records available with A.D.C.L., the\npayment was released to the extent of work done after following the due procedure of the Department and per\nthe terms and conditions of the agreement and after due certification by P.M.C. M/s. L.E.A. Associates South\nAsia Priva te Limited, at every stage, as mentioned in Para No.6(A), to ensur e that the requisite quality &\nquantity checks are done both by the P.M.C. in the presence of the Department & the Principal Contractor .\nP.M.C. (M/s. L.E.A. Associates South Asia Private Limited) is responsible for \"Supervise the construction\nworks of contracto r strictly by the performance indicators and other stipulations contained in Contract\ndocuments and ensure complete compliance concerning technical specifications and various stipulationscontained in the Contract documents with high standards of quality assurance in supervision and the execution\nof work as per agreement\".\n42. The learned Special Public Prosecutor contends that the committee held in the report that the fact\nregarding the raising of outward invoices having a taxable value of Rs.17.71/- crores along with G.S.T . of\nRs.2,81,27,078/- without any supply of Goods or services by Avexa is to be ascertained from M/s. B.S.R.\nInfratech Pvt., Ltd., by the investigating agency .\n43. As seen from the record, the Responden t/State grieves that the directors of the M/s.A vexa company , with a\nmalafide intention to misuse public funds, diverted the public funds secured from the Principal contractor to\nthe shell companies, created fake invoi ces with G.S.T . to the shell companies to avoid input tax credit, and\nthereafter diverted the public funds to the shell companies.\n44. The learned counsel for the Petitioner s contends that when a particular enactment, i.e., the G.S.T . Act,\ncovers the criminal act of an offender , the offender gets out of the net of the Indian Penal Code. The material\non record discloses that the D.G.G.I., Hyderabad, has already investigated in respect of submitting fake\ninvoice bills by the shell companies of A.1's firm under the guise of doing development activities at\nAmaravati Region and proposed a penalty of Rs.16/- crores to the A.1's company under the G.S.T . Act, 2017,\nit establishes that most of the investigation is completed by the D.G.G.I., Hyderabad.\n45. The learned counsel for the Petitioners contends that when a matter is pending  before the proper officer,\nthe Respondent/State is not empowered to investigate it by registering the crime.\n46. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that the Respondent-State has taken a specific stand in the counter by\ncontending that the A.P.C.R.D.A. report dated 22.02.2024 related to the execution of the contract by\nAmaravati Developm ent Corporation Limited with the B.S.R. Infratech Limited  and M/s. Megha Engineering\nand Infrastructure Limited, reveals that the A.D.C.L. effected payments only after following the due\nprocedure, obtaining the P.M.C. certifications at every stage and ensuring the quality of works as per the\nagreement conditions. Therefore, the primary accusation against the accused is their purported creation of\ncounterfeit invoices to siphon public funds. The respondent/state does not conte nd that funds were withdrawn\nwithout fulfilling the requisite standards for project completion.\n47. According to Sectio n 6 of the A.P.G.S.T . Act, particularly Section 6(b), if a proper officer acting under the\nCentral Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 has already initiated proceedings concerning a specific subject\nmatter , no additional proceedings on the same subject matter shall be undertaken by the proper officer under\nthe A.P .G.S.T . Act.\n48. Section 132(1)( b) of the G.S.T . Act states that issuing invoices or bills without actual supply of goods or\nservices, thereby violating the Act or its rules, leading to incorrect availment or utilization of input tax credit\nor tax refund, is deemed an of fence under the Act.\n49. Section 134 of the G.S.T . Act stipulates  that no court can initiate legal proceed ings for any offence under\nthis Act or its rules without prior approval from the Chief Commissioner .\n50. Without expressin g any opinion on the contention raised by the Petitione rs' counsel regarding the\nregistration of the criminal case while the matter is pending before the competent authority , this Court notes\nthat a significant portion of the investiga tion has been completed. The matter is currently under consideration\nby the competent authority , the relea se of the accused persons is unlikely to prejudice the ongoing\ninvestigation.\n51. The existence of the power to arrest is one thing; the justification for exercising it is quite another . Apart\nfrom the power to arrest, the police officers must be able to justify the reasons. No arrest can be made\nroutinely on a mere allegation of the commission of an offence made against a person. It would be prudent\nand wise for a police officer not to arrest without reasonable satisfaction being reached after some\ninvestigation into the genuineness of the allegation. (In this regard, a reference can be made to Arnesh Kumar\nv. State of Bihar  (2014) 8 SCC 273).\n52. It is not the Prosecution's case that the Petitioners did not cooperate with the investigation and are not\navailable for interrogation. There is no indication of a likelihood that the Petitioners would abscond from the\ncourt's jurisdiction. The Petitioners have expressed a willingness to cooperate with the investigation agency .\nThe object of the bail is neither punitive nor preventative. The likelihood of levying accusations to harm or\nembarrass the Petitioners through potential arrest is not improbable, especially in political disputes.53. At this stage, the allegations against the Petitioners are subjected to the trial's  outcome. It is settled law\nthat mere apprehen sion that the accused would tamper with the prosecution evidence or intimidate the\nwitnesses cannot be grounds to refuse bail unless the Prosecution shows that the accused tried for such\ntampering/intimidation.\n54. Given the facts and circumstances of the case coupled with the prima facie  analysis of the nature of\nallegations and the other factors peculiar to this case, this Court views that even  if the Petitioners are granted\npre-arrest bail, there cannot be any apprehension for the Prosecution that they will tamper with the evidence.\nThe material placed on record discloses that the Petitioners have a permanent abode. It is not the Prosecution's\ncase that the Petition ers would flee away  from the jurisdiction of the Court. The facts do not warrant custodial\ninterrogation of the Petitioners. Grantin g anticipatory bail to the Petitioners would not impede the ongoing\ninvestigation, as the material part of the investigation, primarily based on the documentary evidence, is\nalready completed.\n55. Upon careful review of the available  material, as there is no risk of interference with the ongoing\ninvestigation by the Petitioners, this Court finds that anticipatory bail can be granted to the Petitioners under\ncertain conditions:\n(i) Petitioners/Accused are directed to surrender before the Station House Officer, Machavaram Police\nStation, Vijayawada City, within two (2) weeks from today and upon their surrender , they shall be\nreleased on bail upon furnishing a personal bond for Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees One Lakh Only) each\nwith two sureties for a like sum each to the satisfaction of the concerned Investigating Of ficer.\n(ii) Petitioners shall appear before the conc erned Investigating Officer as and when their presence is\nrequired.\n(iii) Petitioners shall cooperate with the investigation and make themselves available for interrogation\nby a police officer as and when required . Furthermore, they are prohibited from making any direct\nor indirect inducement, threat, or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case to\ndissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or any police of ficer.\n(iv) If the Petitioners fail to cooperate with the Investigation agency , the Prosecu tion is at liberty to\nmake an appropriate application seeking cancellation of their bail.\n56. It is explicitly clarified that the observa tions made in this Order are preliminary and pertain solely to the\ndecision on the present applications without indicating a stance on the case's merits. The Investigating Agency\nis affirmed to have the freedom to investigate without being influenced by the observations in this Order .\n57. The Criminal Petitions are allowed, accordingly .\n58. Miscellaneous applications pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n\u25a0\u25a0\n*In favour of assessee."}

Perused the entire record.\n2. The chall enge in the present writ petiti on is to the Demand Order DRC-07, dated 30.12.2023, for the tax\nperiod July, 2017 to March, 2018 under the Telangana Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ('TGST Act') and\nCentral Goods and Services T ax Act, 2017 ('CGST Act').\n3. One of the primary contentions raised by the petitioner in assailing the Demand Order is on the ground that\nthe impugned action being bad for the reason that for the same cause of actio n, the Central Authority i.e.,\nrespondent No.4 has already initiated action and has passed the Order -in-Original on 31.10.2023. It has alsobeen informed that the order passed by respondent No.4 is already under challenge before this Court in\nW.P.No.1357 of 2024 and where there is also an interim order granted by this very Bench on 12.01.2024. In\nview of the aforesai d developments, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that under the provisions of\nSection 6 of CGST Act, the Demand Order now been issued by respondent No.2 is per se bad, illegal and\nunsustainable.\n4. On the previous date of hearing, we have directed the State counsel to seek instructions as to how the\nsubsequent proceedings by the State Authorities would be maintainable.\n5. Today , learned Spec ial Government Pleader for State Tax enters appearance and makes his submission that\nthere appe ars to be lack of information to the State Authorities being provide d from the petitioner side in\nrespect of the Order -in-Original passed by respondent No.4. He further submits that there also appears to be\nno timely information provided by the petitioner in respect of the order passed by respondent No.4 before the\nimpugned order was passed. Therefore, the impugned order has been passed.\n6. It was also the contention of the learned State counsel that the Central Gover nment has issued a Circular\ndated 23.11.2023 vide Circular No.4 of 2023, which mandates that the orders passed in original have to be\nuploaded electronically on the portal so far as legal enforceability is concerned. Learned counsel further\ncontended that in the instant case, as the order has since been not uploaded, the action on the part of the State\nAuthorities cannot be found fault with.\n7. Considering the provisions of Section 6 of CGST Act, what is apparently evident is that once when the\nproceedings have already been drawn and finalized on the same set of facts and issue, there cannot be\nsubsequent proceedings again drawn. Undisputedly , in the instant case, respondent No.4 had already initiated\nproceedings and had concluded the same by passing the Order -in-Original on 31.10.2023. The said order has\nalso been assailed by the assessee befor e this Court in W.P.No.1357 of 2024 and there also appears to be an\ninterim order granted by this Court on 12.01.2024.\n8. Given the said facts and circumstances of the case and in the teeth of Section 6 of the CGST Act, we are of\nthe considered opinion that the two grounds raised by the State Authorities would not be sustainable. Firstly ,\nmere not uploading of the order passe d by the Central Authorities does not by itself empowers the State\nagencies to again initiate the proceedings in which the Central Authority i.e., respondent No.4 has already\ninitiated and passed an Order -in-Origin al. As regards the second ground raised by the learned State counsel\nthat lack of proper and timely intimation by the petitioner , a correspondence made by the petitioner would\nshow that the petitioner has in fact intimated the respondent authorities in this regard time and again.\nMoreover , from the pleadings itself, it reflects that the Order -in-Original passed by respondent No.4, dated\n31.10.2023 was endorsed to the State agencies which is sufficient to draw an inference that the State\nAuthorities were aware or atleast were informed about the proceedings drawn by respondent No.4.\n9. In view thereof, we are of the consider ed opinion that the impugned Demand  Order dated 30.12.2023 for\nthe tax period July. 2017 to March, 2018 would not be sustainable and the same deserves to be and is\naccordingly set aside/quashed.\n10.

The challenge in this writ petition under Article 226 of Constitution of India is to the order of cancellation\nof petitioner's registration of GST , dated 24-4-2023.\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order has been passed in violation of the\nprinciples of natural justice. It has been given retrospective effect. He furthe r submits that the petitioner's\nregistration was suspended on 1-4-2023  without affording any opportunity of hearing and that the order has\nnot been issued in the proper GST Form. Another submission is that the order has not been signed by the\nAssistant Commissioner (ST).\n4. Learned Assistant Government Pleade r submits that the petitioner has approached this Court after about\none year of the impugned order . He submits that the show cause notice was given to the petitioner but he did\nnot file response. It is further submitted that the order is signed digitally .\n5. We have considered the submissions advanced and perused the material on record.\n6. On a specific query , to the learned counsel for the petitioner , on the point of laches in filing the writ\npetition, he submits that the period of limitation for filing the writ petition is three years. He emphasized that\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in Godr ej Sara Lee Ltd.  v. Excise and taxation Officer -cum-Assessing Authority  [Civil\nAppeal No. 5393 of 2010, dated 1-2-2023], has so held. W e carefully perused the said judgment.\n7. There the facts were that there the Apex Court was dealing with a case where the duty was paid on account\nof mis-con struction, mis-application or wrong interpretation of a provision of law, notification or regulation.\nThe questi on was if it was open to the manufacturer to say that the decision of a High Court or the Supreme\nCourt, as the ease may be, in the case of another person has made him aware of the mistake of law and\ntherefore, he was entitled to refund of duty paid by him? The question was could he invoke Section 72 of the\nContract Act in such a case and claim refund and whether in such a case and claim refund it can be said that\nreading Section 72 of the Contract Act along with Section 17(1)( c) of the Limitation Act, 1963, the period of\nlimitation for making such a claim for refund, whether by way of a suit or by way of a writ petition, is three\nyears from the date of discovery of such mistake of law?\n8. Learned counsel for the petitioner laid emphasis on this part, in para-70 but we are of the considered view\nthat he is mistaken that was the question as was involved.\n9. The Hon'ble Apex Court, held that the theory of mistake of law and the consequent period of limitation of\nthree years from the date of discovery of such mistake of law cannot be invoked by an assessee taking\nadvantage of the decision in another assessee's case. All claims for refund ought to be, and ought to have\nbeen, only under and in accordance with Rule 11/Section 11B and under no other provision and in no other\nforum. The decisions of the Court sayin g to the contrary were overruled therein. In the aforesaid case it has\nnot been held that the period of limitation for filing writ petition is three years.\n10. In the State of Jammu and Kashmir  v. R.K.Zalpuri  [2015] 15 SCC 602 on the aspect of delay and latches\nin filing the writ petition, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:\n21. In this regard reference to a passage emom from Karnataka y_untohn Power oeiver Corpn. coron.\nLtd. Ltd.  v. v. K.Thangappanz would be apposite: (SCC p.  325,para 6)\n\"6. Delay or laches is one of the factors  which is to be borne in mind by the High Court when they\nexercise their discretionary powers unde r Article 226 of the Constitution. In an appropriate case the\nHigh Court may refuse to invoke its extraordinary powers if there is such negligence or omission on\nthe part of the applicant to assert his right as taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other\ncircumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party .\"\nAfter so stating the Court after referring to the authority in State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswa/s restated the\nprinciple articulated  in earlier pronouncements, which is to the following ef fect: (SCC p. 326, para 9)\n\"9.... the High Court  in exercise of its discretion does not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent\nor the acquiescent and the lethar gic. If there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner and such\ndelay is not satisfac torily explained, the High Court may decline to intervene and grant relief in\nexercise of its writ jurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is premised on a number of factors. The\nHigh Court does not ordinarily permit a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy because it is\nlikely to cause confu sion and public inconvenience and bring, in-its-train new injustices, and if writ\njurisdiction is exercised after unreason able delay , it may have the effect of inflicting not only\nhardship and inconvenience but also injustice on third parties. It was pointed out that when writjurisdiction is invoked, unexplained delay coupled with the creation of third-party rights in the\nmeantime is an important factor which also weighs with the High Court in deciding whether or not\nto exercise such jurisdiction.\"\nThe Hon'ble Apex Court clearly held that W rit Court while deciding writ petition is required to remain alive to\nthe nature of the claim and the unexplained delay on the part of the writ petitioner .\n11. In Mrinmoy Maity  v. Chhanda Koley  2024 SCC OnLine SC 551, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that delay\nand laches is one of the factors whic h should be borne in mind by the High Court while exercising\ndiscretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of Constitution of India in given case, the High Court may refuse\nto invoke the extraordinary power . In para Nos.1 1 & 12, the Hon'ble Apex Court observes as follows:\n11. For filing of a writ petition, there  is no doubt that no fixed period of limitation is prescribed.\nHowever , when the extraordinary jurisdiction of the writ court is invoked, it has to be seen as to whether\nwithin a reasonable time same has been invoked and even submitting of memorials would not revive the\ndead cause  of action or resurrect the cause of action which has had a natural death. In such circumstances\non the ground of delay and latches alone, the appeal ought to be dismissed or the applicant ought to be\nnon-suited. If it is found that the writ petitioner is guilty of delay and latches, the High Court ought to\ndismiss the petition on that sole ground itself, in as much as the writ courts are not to indulge in\npermitting such indolent litigant to take advantage of his own wrong. It is true that there cannot be any\nwaiver of fundamental right but while exercising discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226, the High\nCourt will have to necessarily take into consideration the delay and latches on the part of the applicant in\napproaching a writ court. This Court in the case of Tridip Kumar Dingal  v. State of W.B. , (2009) 1 SCC\n768 has held to the following ef fect:\n\"56. We are unable  to uphold the contention. It is no doubt true that there can be no waiver of\nfundamental right. But while exercising discretionary jurisdiction under Articles 32, 226, 227 or 136\nof the Constitution, this Court takes into account certain factors and one of such considerations is\ndelay and laches on the part of the applicant in approaching a writ court. It is well settled that power\nto issue a writ is discretionary . One of the grounds for refusing reliefs under Article 32 or 226 of the\nConstitution is that the petitioner isguilty of delay and laches.\n57. If the petitioner wants to invoke jurisdiction of a writ court, he Should come to the Court at the\nearliest reasonably possible opportunity  Inordinate delay in making the motion for writ will indeed\nbe a good ground for refusing to exercise such discretionary jurisdiction. The uanderlying object of\nthis principle is not to encourage agitation of stale claims and exhume matters which have already\nbeen dispo sed of or settled or where the rights of third parties have accrued in the meantime (vide\nState of M.P. v. Bhailal Bhai, [AIR 1964  SC 1006 : (1964) 6 SCR 261], Moon Mills Ltd.v .Industrial\nCourt, [AIR 1967 SC 1450] and Bhoop Singh  v. Union of India  , [(1992) 3 SCC 136: (1992) 21 ATC\n675 : (1992) 2 SCR 969]). This principle applies even in case of an infringement of fundamental\nright (vide Tilokchand Motichand . H.B. Munshi, [(1969) 1 SCC 110), Durga Prashad v. Chief\nController of Imports & Exports, [(1969) 1 SCC 185] and Rabindranath Bose  v. Union of India  ,\n[(1970) 1 SCC 84]).\n58. There is no upper limit and there is no lower limit as to when a person can approach a court. The\nquestion is one of discretion and has to be decided on the basis of facts before the court depending\non and varying from  case to case. It will depend upon what the breach of funda mental right and the\nremedy claimed are and when and how the delay arose.\"\n12. It is apposite to take note of the dicta laid down by this Court in Karnataka Power Corportion Ltd. v.\nK. Thangappan, (2006) 4 SCC 322 whereunder it has been held that the High Court may refuse to\nexercise extraordinary jurisdiction if there is negligence or omissions on the part of the applicant to assert\nhis right. It has been further held thereunder:\n\"6 . Delay or laches  is one of the factors  which is to be borne in mind by the High Court when they\nexercise their discretionary powers unde r Article 226 of the Constitution. In an appropriate case the\nHigh Court may refuse to invoke its extraordinary powers if there is such negligence or omission on\nthe part of the applicant to assert his right as taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other\ncircumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party . Even where fundamental right is involved the\nmatter is still within  the discretion of the Court as pointed out in Durga Prasha d v. Chief Controllerof Imports and Expo rts, [(1969) 1 SCC 185 : AIR 1970 SC 769]. Of course, the discretion has to be\nexercised judicially and reasonably .\n7. What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes Peacock in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Prosper\nArmstrong Hurd, [[L.R.] 5 P.C. 221 : 22 WR 492] (PC at p. 239) was approved by this Court in\nMoon Mills Ltd. v. M.R. Meher , [AIR 1967 SC 1450] and Maharashtra SRTC  v. Shri Balwant\nRegular Motor Service  , [(1969) 1 SCR 808 AIR 1969 SC 329]. Sir Barnes had stated:\n\"Now , the doctrine of laches in courts of equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where\nit would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has, by his conduct done\nthat which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and\nneglect he has though perhaps not waiving that remedy , yet put the other party in a situation in\nwhich it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in\neither of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case, if an\nargument against relief, which otherwis e would be just, is founded upon mere delay , that delay\nof course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitation, the validity of that defence must\nbe tried upon princi ples substantially equitable. Two circumstances always important in such\ncases are, the length  of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval which might\naffect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the\nother , so far as it relates to the remedy .\"\n8. It would  be appropriate to note certai n decisions of this Court in which this aspect has been dealt\nwith in relation to Article 32 of the Constitution. It is apparent that what has been stated as regards\nthat article would apply, a fortiori, to Article 226. It was observed in Rabindran ath Bose v. Union of\nIndia, [(1970) 1 SCC 84 : AIR 1970 SC 470] that no relief can be given to the petitioner who\nwithout any reasona ble explanation approaches this Court under Article 32 after inordinate delay . It\nwas stated that though Article 32 is itself a guaranteed right, it does not follow from this that it was\nthe intention of the Constitution-makers that this Court should disregard all principles and grant\nrelief in petitions filed after inordinate delay .\n9. It was stated in State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal, [(1986) 4 SCC 566: AIR 1987 SC 251] that the\nHigh Court in exerc ise of its discretion does not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent or the\nacquiescent and the lethar gic. If there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner and such delay\nis not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may decline to intervene and grant relief in exercise of\nits writ jurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is premised on a number of factors. The High Court\ndoes not ordinarily permit a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy because it is likely to cause\nconfusion and public inconvenience and bring, in its train new injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is\nexercised after unreasonable delay , it may have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and\ninconvenience but also injustice on third parties. It was pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is\ninvoked, unexplained delay coupled with the creation of third-party rights in the meantime is an\nimportant factor which also weighs with the High Court in deciding whether or not to exercise such\njurisdiction.\"\n12. The petiti oner in the Writ Petition has not explained the laches in filing the writ petition belatedly . Its true\nthat there is no period of limitation for filing the writ petition but at the same time, the petitioner has to\napproach within reasonable time. In the facts of the present case that the impugned order was passed with\nopportunity of hearing, the petitioner approached this Court under Article 226 of Constitution of India after\nalmost one year, is not approaching in a reasonable time. The laches have also not been explained.\nConsequently , we are not inclined to entertain the writ petition in aforesaid ground.\n13. The show  cause notice dated 01.04.2023 was issued to the petitioner and the petitioner did not submit any\nreply . In the order of cancellation in the first sentence it shows that \"this has reference to your reply dated\n18.04.2023 in response to the notice to show cause dated 01.04.2023\", and in the second sentence, \"it clearly\nstates that no reply to notice was filed by the petitioner\". The case of the petitioner is that he did not file any\nreply . Consequently , in our view there is no violation of principles of natural justice since the petitioner was\nserved with the show cause notice and he did not file any reply .\n14. So far as the opportunity before passing the order of suspension is concerned, the suspension was passed\nduring the pendency of the proceedings for cancellation, the opportunity of hearing is not required. Any legal\nprovision could also not be placed before us that opportunity was required before suspension.ANURAG15. The impugned order shows that the same was digitally signed. Consequentl y, there is no force in the\nsubmission that the order is not signed.\n16. In view of the aforesaid consideration, the argument that the impugned order has been given retrospective\neffect need not consideration as we are not inclined to entertain the writ petition on the ground of laches.\n17. The W rit Petition is dismissed.\n18. No orders as to costs.\n19. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

Circular No. 166/22/2021-GST , dated 17-11-2021\nORDER\n \nC. Praveen Kumar , J. - Since the issue involved in these Writ Petitions being one and the same, they are\nheard together and disposed of by this Common Order . W.P. No. 17958 of 2022 is taken as a lead petition in\ndeciding the issues involved.\n2. The present Writ Petition is filed assailing the Endorsement, dated 28-5-2022, issued by the Assistant\nCommissioner (State Tax), Kadapa-I Circle, Kadapa, rejecting the request of the Petitioner for refund along\nwith interest, as illegal, improper and incorrect.\n3. The facts, in issue, are as under:\ni. The Petitio ner was engaged in execution  of works contract having its Registered Office at Kadapa,\nwith regis tration under Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, ['CGST Act'], and State Goods\nand Services T ax Act, 2017, ['SGST Act'], with ef fect from 1-7-2017.\nii. It is said that, the Petitioner availed Input Tax Credit and adjusted the same against an output\nliability in its monthly returns. It is further stated that, in addition to the amoun t available as Input\nTax Credit, the Petitioner also has credit of TDS by the contractees under Section 51 of CGST Act/\nSGST Act @ 2%. The amount is said to be lying as excess credit to the Petition er in the ElectronicCash Ledger and it does not get adjuste d against the output liability , in view of the excess amount\nlying in the Electronic Credit Ledger . It is said that, the amount credited in the form of TDS is\neligible to be refunded to the Petitioner under Section 54(1) of the CGST Act. As the excess\namount was lying, in the Electronic Cash Ledger , the Petitioner filed three [03] separate\napplications for refund of excess credit lying in Electronic Cash Ledger .\niii. The refund applications were processed by the first Respondent leading to issuance of GST RFD-08\non 5-2-2020, proposing to reject the application for refund, on the ground that the Petitioner has not\nfiled relevant documents, in terms of Section 54(3)(4) of SGST Act. The Petitioner was given time\nto file reply till 20-2-2020. But, howeve r, the Petitioner failed to submit his explanation. Inspite of\nthe same, the first Respondent issued a Refund Sanction Order in GST RFD-0 6, dated 19-3-2020,\nfor all the three [03] applications. These amounts were to be credited to the bank account specified\nin the application of the Petitioner . The Order also categorically states that, the application is\nrejected for an amount of Rupees \"Zero\".\niv . Believing that the applications made by the Petitioner were allowed and as the amount was not\nbeing credited in-sp ite of sanction, the Petitioner addressed a letter on 11-6-2020 to the first\nRespondent requesting him to release the refund at the earliest. As there was no response, the\nPetitioner once again brought to the notice of the first Respondent, the inaction on their part in not\nreleasing the amount in-spite of the Order . The said reminder was on 20-5-2022.\nv . The Petitioner also claims to have brought to the notice of the first Respondent the Circular , dated\n17-11-2021, issued by CBIC, New Delhi, stipulating that any amount unutilized in Electronic Cash\nLedger is to be refun ded immediately under Section 54 of the CGST Act. In response to the request\nmade by the Petitioner on 20-5-2022, the first Respondent issued the impu gned endorsement\nobserving inter alia that there was no response from the Petitioner for the notice issued in RFD-08;\nopportunity of personal hearing was not availed by the Petitioner and, accordingly , rejected the\nrequest for refund. It was also observed by the first Respondent that due to some technical glitches\nin the website/portal, the refund rejected  amount could not be reflected in State ment No. 4 instead\nof in Statement No. 3. This endorsement, dated 28-5-2022, is sought to be challenged in this Writ\nPetition.\n4. Sri. S. Dwarakanath Reddy , learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the Petitioner , mainly submits that, the\nimpugned endorsem ent could not have been passed by the authority as it has no statutory force. He further\nsubmits that, the endorsement is silent  with regard to the provisions of law under which it is passed. He\nfurther submits that, in the applications filed by the Petitioner seeking implementation of the order , the first\nRespondent issued the endorsement setting aside the earlier order , which virtually amounts to reviewing the\nOrder , and such a request was never made by the Petitioner . He further submits  that the Order in Form-GST -\nRFD-06 clearly indicate that against the column \"reason for refund\", it has been specifically mentioned that\n'refund of excess balance in Electronic Cash Ledger', and also the concluding portion of the Order clearly\ndescribe an amount of Rs.85,14,656/- being sanctioned under Sub-section 5 of Section 54 of the Act. He\nfurther submits that, even as on today , the website/portal shows acceptance of refund application of the\nPetitioner . In view of all the circumstances, learned Senior Counsel would contend that the authority erred in\nissuing endorsement.\n5. Sri. Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Govern ment Pleader for Commercial Tax, appearing for the Respondents,\nopposed the same contending that the application of the Petitioner was not allowed, as there appears to be an\nerror in the Order passed by the first Respondent. He would submit that, the Order relied upon by the learned\nSenior Counsel also shows that the request of the Petitioner for refund is rejected since the Petitioner has not\nsubmitted documents along with reply . In view of the above, he would submit that the order under challenge\nrequires no interference.\n6. As stated earlier , the present Writ Petitions came to be filed challenging the endorsement, dated 28-5-2022,\nissued by the first Respondent, wherein , the request of the Petitioner for refund  of excess credit lying in the\nElectronic Cash Ledger came to be rejected. This Order came to be passed pursuant to representations made\nby the Petitioner seeking refund of the amount, in view of the approval granted  by the first Respondent in its\nOrder , dated 19-3-2020. It is to be noted here that, in-stead of considering the application of the Petitioner for\nrefund, which was made basing on the Order dated 19-3-2020, the impugned endorsement came to be made\nrejecting the request. It is also to be noted here that, the said endorsement does not reflect any provision of\nlaw under which it has been made or passed. It has simply overturned the earlier order , on the ground that dueto some technical glitches in the website/portal, the request for refund amount of Rs.85,14,656/- is reflected in\nStatement No. 4. Further , as stated above, this endorsement has no statutory force, as it does not reflect the\nprovision of law under which the said endorsement came to be issued. Since, the impugned endorsement came\nto be made without any statutory basis and as it came to be passed in an application made by the Petitioner\nseeking refund in view of the earlier order passed, the said endorsement is liable to be set-aside, as bad in law\nand, accordingly , the same is set-aside.\n7. At this stage Sri. Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax, appearing for the\nRespondents, would submit that the Order, dated 19-3-2020, passed in favour of the Petitioner was an\nerroneous one, which is apparent from a reading of the proceedings and the material on record. The same is\ndisputed by Sri.S. Dwarakanath Reddy , learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the Petitioner , stating that, if\nreally it was a mistake, steps should have been taken to get the same rectified , but till date the same is not\ndone.\n8. It is true, though the Order was passed on 19-3-2020 sanctioning an amount of Rs.85,14,656/- to the\nPetitioner under Sub-section 5 of Section 54 of the Act, no effort was made to get the same rectified. But a\nperusal of the first page of the Order , dated 19-3-2020, clearly gives a reason for rejecting the refund. It has\nbeen categorically stated that, as the tax payer has not submitted reply along with documents, the refund claim\nis rejected. Having said so, in the last page of the Order , the Assistant Commissioner [ST], sanctioned the\namount referred to above. It appears that, a mistake has crept in. In-fact, the website/portal of the Department\nshows sanction of refund and the same is said to have been displayed even now. But, it is also to be noted here\nthat, in Form-GST -RFD-08, which is a notice for rejection of application for refund, it is clearly mentioned\nthat the refund claim is rejected under Section 54(3)(4) of SGST Act, for want of documents.\n9. Further , no notice was given to the Petitioner prior to passing of the Order rejecting the request made. On\nthe other hand, the Order , dated 28-5-2022, came to be passed basing on the representation made by the\nPetitioner . Therefore , the issue as to whether the request of the Petitioner was accepted or not is not clear from\nthe available record.\n10. At this stage, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioner would contend that, the provisions of\nSection 54(3)(4) of SGST Act, do not apply to the case on hand, as it relates to excess input credit and that the\ncase of the Petitioner falls under Section 54(1) of Act. He further submits that, if the matter is remanded back\nnow for consideration afresh, the Petitioner will be losing interest of two [02] years, since the authority , in all\nprobability , would deal with the request of the Petitioner from the date of Order of this Court unless otherwise\nit is made clear .\n11. Sri. Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Govern ment Pleader for Commercial Tax, appearing for the Respondents,\nwould submit that the matter may be remanded back by treating the applicatio n of the Petitioner as made in\nthe year 2020 as the application for refund of excess credit, so that the grievance of the Petitioner that he will\nbe losing interest can be take care of, if any .\n12. Having regard to the dispute involve d now, namely , as to whether the request of the Petitioner was\naccepted or not; the Writ Petitions are allowed setting aside the impugned Order , dated 28-5-2022, and the\nmatters are remanded back to the Assistant Commissioner [State Tax] (1st Respondent herein) to deal with the\nsame afres h after accepting the applications filed by the Petitioner in the month of January 2020, for refund of\nexcess balance in the Electronic Cash Ledger , in accordance with law, by giving an opportunity of hearing to\nthe Petitioner , preferably within a period of six [06] weeks from the date of receipt of the Order . No order as\nto costs.\n13. It is needl ess to mention that, three [03] applications made by the Petitioner on 24-1-2020 vide ARN/RFN\nNos.AA3701200188994, AA370120021735P and AA370120021 1731, be treated as applications for refund\nmade in the year 2020 itself and if it is found that the Petitioner is eligible for refund of excess credit in the\nElectronic Cash Ledger , the said amount shall be paid to the accounts of the Petitioner along with interest as\nprescribed under law .\n14. As a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any , pending shall stand closed.\n\u25a0\u25a0*In favour of assessee."}

The State Government through the Andhr a Pradesh Civil Supplies\nCorporation (APCSC) procures paddy and gives to the rice mills for milling. APCSC allows the petitioner\nto retain the broken rice, bran and husk obtained in the course of milling of the paddy . The petitioner sells\nthe said broken rice, bran and husk. The broken rice and husk are exempted from tax and hence, no GST\nwas to be paid on the same.\n\u25a0 The revenue passed the impugned assessment order imposing GST not only on milling charges of Rs. 15\nper quintal, but also on the value of by-products which were allowed to be retained by the assessee\ntreating the by-products as part of consideration.\n\u25a0 On W rit Petition:\nHELD\n \nWhether impugned assessment order levying GST on estimated by-products value, treating such by-products\nas part of consideration for milling, is legally sustainable under provisions of CGST/APGST Act, 2017 or\nnot?\n\u25a0 As seen, Custom Milling Rice is an arrangement where the Government through the Civil Supplies\nCorporation gets the paddy milled into rice through the millers. For this purpose, the 4th respondent enters\ninto an agreement with the millers incorporating therein the method and manner of milling the paddy . In\nthe above process, in the context of GST Act, the assessee shall be regarded as 'supplier'. Under section\n2(105), supplier in relation to any goods or services or both, shall mean the person supplying the said\ngoods or services or both and shall include an agent as such on behalf of such supplier . The assessee, in\nview of undertaking the exercise of milling the paddy , offers 'services' to 4th respondent within the\nmeaning of section 2(102). Similarly , the 4th respondent Corporation is called  as 'recipient' of services\nwithin the meaning of section 2(93). What the assessee undertakes is 'job-work' as per section 2(68). The\nterm 'job-work' means any treatment or process undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another\nregistered person and the expression job-work shall be construed accordingly . The returns, which the\nassessee gets out of milling is known as 'consideration' within the meaning of section 2(31) of GST Act.\nAs per this provision, the consideration maybe either in the form of money or otherwise.[Para 13]\n\u25a0 Be that it may, a doubt seems to have arisen as to whether custom milling of paddy by the rice millers for\nCivil Supplies Corporation is liable to GST or whether it is exempted under S.No.55 of Notification\n12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28-6-2017. In this regard, clarif ication was issued in\nF.No.354/263/2017-TRU by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, in its letter dated 20-11-2017\nto the Commercial T ax Department. [Para 14]\n\u25a0 From the above clarification, it is clear that custom milling of paddy is not exempted and on the other\nhand, it is a taxable service and liable to GST at the rate of 5 per cent on the processing char ges and not on\nthe entire value of rice.[Para 15]\n\u25a0 To the above exten t, there is no controversy . However , the bone of conten tion in this case is what\nconstitutes the 'consideration' for levy of GST. According to revenue, not only the milling charges at therate of Rs. 15 per quintal but also the by-products received by the assessee constitute the consideration,\nwhereas, the contention of the assessee is that by-products were just left by 4th respondent with the\nassessee as they were not useful to it, for, their disposal was not economically viable. Further , the by-\nproducts were left to the assessee as compensation to replenish the shortfall of the rice to make 67 per cent\nof yield on milling.[Para 16]\n\u25a0 In order to appreciate the above respective contentions and to know the nature and character of by-\nproducts, one should necessarily refer to the terms of the agreement. It is pertin ent to mention here that in\nsimilar circumstances, in the case of Food Corporation of India v. State of A.P. 1997 SCC Online AP\n1143, a Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh held that when the terms between the parties\nare under an agreem ent, those terms are sacrosanct and cannot be explained otherwise by adducing oral\nevidence. The facts in that case briefly are that the FCI entered into agreement s with different millers to\nwhom it supplied paddy for the purpose of milling and paid hire charges and milling charges. As per the\nmilling agreement, the FCI agreed to give the by-products such as broken rice, husk and bran to the\nmillers. The Assessing Authority added the value of the by-products to the turnover of the FCI for the\npurpose of computation of Sales Tax, treating such by-products to have been sold by the FCI to the\nmillers. The contention of the FCI was that it just allowed the millers to treat the by-products as their\nproperty but there was no sale between them and it did not receive any remuneration in that regard and\ntherefore same cannot be added to its turnover . In that context, the Division Bench perused the relevant\nterm relating to by-products and observed that it does not speak of the by-products having been allowed as\nremuneration for milling. All that it says is that the by-products are not the responsibility of the assessee\nand conce des that these by-products are the property of the agent. There is nothing to show that the\ntransfer of property in the goods or the by-products to be by way of sale, but only indicates that the FCI\ndoes not concern or bother itself for the broken rice, etc., for which it has no use and does not want to be\nburdened with the clause would not lead to the proof of there having been a sale. The transfer of property\nin the goods might take place even when  there is no sale, say where there is a voluntary transfer or gifting\naway of the goods in question.[Para 17]\n\u25a0 From the above, it percolates:\n (i) When the terms are entered in the form of a written agreement, the same are sacrosanct and shall be\nlooked into to know the purpose for which by-products were given to the miller and not by adducing oral\nevidence.\n (ii) When the terms only specify a certain amount as remuneration and nothing else is indicated towards\nremuneration, no further condition can be regarded as remuneration.\n (iii) When the terms say that the by-produ cts shall be the property of the agent (miller), such transfer of\nproperty in the goods cannot be treated as sale.\n In the light of above  jurisprudence, the terms of the agreement have to be meticulously analys ed to know\nwhether in the instant case, the by-products assumed the character of 'consideration'.[Para 18]\n\u25a0 Along with the counter , the 4th respondent filed copy of agreement dated 18-12-2017 entered into by it\nwith the assessee. The agreement contains 34 clauses meticulously incorporatin g therein, all the relevant\nterms relating to CMR. Clause No. 22 relates to by-products.It says that the mill shall retain all by-\nproducts such as brokens, bran, husk etc., derived during the process of milling. The mill shall be\nresponsible to incur expenses and taxes on sale of by-pr oducts. With regard to the payment  of\nconsideration i.e., milli ng charges, a separate clause i.e., Clause No. 17 is included which says that the\nCorporation will pay milling charges as fixed by the GOI for the KMS 2017-18. The milling charges are\ninclusive of transpor tation of paddy and rice upto a distance of 8 KMs. and other incidentals upto delivery\nof rice to the FCI/Corporation godown. Thus, as can be seen, the above two clauses couched in the\nagreement are distinct and independent  to each other . Whereas, Clause No. 17 says that milling charges\nwill be paid as fixed  by the GOI (admittedly at the rate of 15 per quintal), Clause No. 22 states that the\nmill shall retain all the by-products such as brokens, bran, husk etc., derived during the process of milling.\nThere is no slightest insinuation in either clause that the by-products shall form part of the consideration.\nIf the parties to the agreement had such intention, nothing prevented them to do so. As is observed, all the\nterms of CMR, both significant and trivial, are meticulously incorporated. For instance, it was menti oned\nthat the mill shall deliver raw rice - 67 per cent and boiled rice - 68 per cent as against the paddy delivered\nfor CMR; the mill shall bear unloading charges, insurance, tarpaulin, ropes, dunnage material,prophylactic and curative treatment expenditure etc; the mill shall use SBT gunnies supplied with paddy\nstocks and shall return the left over gunnies to the corporation, failing which, 60 per cent of the cost of the\ngunny will be collected from the mill etc. Going by the way the aforesaid terms are meticulously\nincorporated, one can logically conclude that, if the parties wanted to covenant that by-products shall form\npart of the consider ation, they would have mentioned in clear terms. Therefor e, it is to be held that the\nabsence of such mentioning is an indicative that the by-products which are allowed to be retained by the\nassessee are not the part of the consideration. Both the above clauses cannot be conjuncted to bring the by-\nproducts into the purview of consideration.[Para 19]\n\u25a0 In the above context, the ar gument of the revenue that since the later part of Clause No. 22 ordains that the\nassessee shall be responsible to pay tax on sale of by-products, the same shall be treated as part of\nconsideration, cannot be countenanced. Treating the by-products as part of consideration and payment of\ntax on sale of by-products are two different aspects. The assessee has to pay tax on sale of by-products (if\nthey are taxable), whether he received the by-products from 4th respondent either towards part of\nconsideration or freely . Therefore, the later part of Clause No. 22 is not a determinative factor for holding\nthat the by-products are part of the consideration. On the other hand, the submission of the assessee that\nthe by-products are given to the assessee towards compensation appears to be logically correct. As per\nClause No. 8 the assessee has to handover 67 per cent of raw rice and 68 per cent of boiled rice as against\nthe paddy delivered  to him for milling. The submission of assessee is that the actual yield will be 61 per\ncent to 62 per cent only and he has to replenish the shortfall by incurring expenditure and therefore to\ncompensate him, the by-products were allowed to be retained by him free of cost. On a conspectus of the\nterms of agreement, it is held that the by-products form part of compensation but not consideration. Thus,\nit is to be held that in the impugned order, the 1st respondent erroneously concluded that the miller was\nallowed to retain the by-products towards consideration, though such import is impermissible from the\nterms of the agreement. Therefore, the impugned order to the extent of including the value of by-products\nto the milling char ges and assessing tax is legally unsustainable.[Para 20]\n\u25a0 The objection of the revenue regarding maintainability of Writ Petition in view of availability of\nalternative remedy is concerned, true that as against the impugned Assessment Order an appeal is\nprovided under section 107. It is also true that this Court will not generally entertain writ when efficacious\nalternative remedy is available. However , since the facts in the present case are squarely covered by the\nratio laid by the Division Bench in Food Corporation of India  (supra ) and the 1st respondent without\nconsidering the same committed legal error on sheer assumptions, it was thought apposite to entertain the\nwrit petition instead of driving the assessee to the Appellate Authority . In this regard, the decisions relied\nupon by the revenue can be distinguished. In Assistant Commissioner (CT) LTU v. Glaxo Smith Kline\nConsumer Health Care Ltd. [2020] 116 taxmann .com 417 the question for consideration before Apex\nCourt was whether the High Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction ought to entertain a challenge to the\nAssessment Order on the sole ground that the statutory remedy of appeal against that order was foreclosed\nby the law of limitation. In that case, as against the Assessment Order , the assessee filed a belated appeal\ninstead of within 30 days from the date of receipt of the order copy . The same was dismissed being barred\nby limitation and also as no sufficient cause was made out. Thereafter , a writ petition was filed before\nHigh Court challenging the Assessment Order , but not the appellate order . Ultimately , the writ petition\nwas allowed setting aside the impugned Assessment Order and the assessee was relegated before the\nAssessing Authority  for consideration of the matter afresh after hearing the assessee. The same was\nchallenged by the revenue before Apex Court. The Apex Court found fault with the order of the High\nCourt mainly for the reason that as per section 31 of A.P. Value Added Tax, 2005, an appeal could be filed\nwithin 30 days from  the date of receiving the order and the Appellate Authority  can condone the delay in\nfiling appeal upto 30 days more and therefore, the Appellate Authority is not empowered to condone delay\nbeyond the aggregat e period of 60 days from the date of the order , but the High Court without considering\nthese provisions,  set aside the original Assessment Order . In the case on hand, the Assessment Order was\npassed 29-10-2018 and as per section 107, an appeal shall be filed within three  (3) months from the date\nof communication of the order . The Writ petition is filed on 17-12-2018 i.e., well within the period of\nlimitation for filing appeal. Having regard to the dictum laid in Glaxo Smith's case ( supra ), this Court can\neither entertain the writ petition or refer the assessee to Appellate authority . Since the impugned order was\npassed having no regard to the law laid down in the case of Food Corporation of India (supra ), the writ\nwas entertained. For the same reason, the other decisions relied upon by the revenue are not followed.\n[Para 21]\n\u25a0 The objec tion raised by the 4th respondent that in view of the arbitration clause, the writ petition is notmaintainable, has no teeth. It should be noted that there are no disputes between the assessee and the 4th\nrespondent with regard to the implementation of the terms of the agreement. On the other hand, the\ndispute is between the revenue and the assessee as to whether or not the by-products form part of the\nconsideration. Since such a dispute cannot be referred to and resolved by the Arbitrator , the Writ Petition\nis very much maintainable.[Para 22]\n\u25a0 In the result, this Writ Petition is allowed and the impugned Assessment Order passed by the 1st\nrespondent insofar as it relates to the levy of GST on the value of by-products i.e., broken rice, bran and\nhusk treati ng them as part of the consid eration paid to the assessee for milling of the paddy , is set aside.\n[Para 23]\nCASE REVIEW\n \nFood Corporation of India  v.

No. CGST/2017-18/05 dated 29-10-2018 for the tax period July, 2017 to February , 2018 passed by\nthe Respondent No. 1 levying GST on the value of broken rice, bran and husk  obtained by the petitioner on\nmilling of the paddy of the Respondent No. 4 which were allowed to be retaine d by the petitioner in addition\nto the milling charges as compensation/exchange for the own rice supplied by the petitioner to the Respondent\nNo. 4 to make up the shortfall in the yield, as contrary to the law and consequently  set aside the same or in the\nalternative direct the Respondent No. 4 to pay the GST liability of the petitio ner and pass such other order\ndeemed fit.\n2. The petitioner's case is thus:\n(a) The petitioner is a Rice Miller and registered dealer under APGST Act, 2017 (for short, \"GST Act\")\non the rolls of Respondent No. 2. The State Government through the Andhra Pradesh Civil Supplies\nCorporation i.e., the Respondent No. 4 herein procures paddy from the ryots and gives to the rice\nmills for milling and handing over to Respondent No. 4 for public distribution. As a consideration\nfor milling, the Resp ondent No. 4 pays charges at the rate of 15% per one quintal of paddy milled.\nAs per the terms of the agreement, the Rice Millers have to supply rice equivalent to 67% of the\npaddy given for milling irrespective of the yield. In fact, the actual yield will be around 61% to\n62% only. The balance of 5% to 6% has to be provided by the petitioner to the Respondent No. 4\nout of his own stock . Therefore, as a compensation/exchange for the same, the Respondent No. 4\nallows the petitioner to retain the broken rice, bran and husk obtained in the course of milling of the\npaddy . The petitioner sells the said broken rice, bran and husk. The broken rice and husk are\nexempted from tax and hence, no GST need to be paid on the same. But, the petitioner pays tax on\nthe bran at the rate of 5%.\n(b) The 1st respondent conducted the inspection of the premises of the petitioner  and issued a show\ncause notice dated 22-5-2018, for which the petitioner submitted his objections/reply . Whereupon,\nthe 1st respondent passed the impugned  assessment order  vide Ref. No. CGST/2017-18/05 dated\n29-10-2018 imposing the GST not only on milling charges of Rs. 15/- per quintal, but also on the\nvalue of by-products which were allowe d to be retained by the petitioner treating  the by-products as\npart of consideration.\n(c) The furthe r case of the petitioner is that neither the petitioner nor 4th respondent had anticipated\nthat the GST would be attracted and therefore, no GST was added to the consideration/char ges paid\nto the petitioner for milling of the paddy . Further it was assumed that as the 4th respondent is a unit\nof the State Government, the petitioner was under the impression that even if any tax law was\nattracted, the same would be paid by the 4th respondent directly to the GST authorities as is beingdone in the case of Rural Development cess which is being paid directly by the Food Corporation\nof India to the Department. Hence, the petitioner did not collect any GST from the 4th respondent.\nHence, the 1st respondent cannot subject to tax any amount in excess of Rs. 15/-per quintal. In fact,\nthe broken rice, bran and husk were given to the petitioner by the 4th respondent not as\nconsideration, but in exchange for the own rice given by the petitioner to make  up the shortfall of\nthe rice after milling . The petitioner has paid tax on the bran whereas the broke n rice and husk are\nexempted from the tax under the GST Act. Therefore, levying tax on the value of the by-products is\nlegally unsustainable. At any rate even if the GST liability is attracted, the same has to be tacked to\nthe 4th respondent who is the recipient of the services.\nHence, the writ petition.\n3. The 1st respondent has filed counter inter alia  contending thus:\n(a) It is contended that as per the terms of the agreement between the petitioner and 4th respondent, the\npetitioner would retain bye products. The bye products which are retained can only be treated as\npart of consideration for the work agreed  to be done i.e., custom milling. Both the parties arrived  @\nRs. 15/- per quintal only after considering the fact that the petitioner herein would retain the bye\nproducts. Further , as per the terms of the agreement, the taxes payable for the bye products are to be\nborne by the petitioner herein.\n(b) In the present transa ction, the rice miller  is running the service of converting the paddy into the rice\nwhich is \"service\". Thus, the rice miller is the supplier of the service and Government or the Civil\nSupplies Corporation is the recipient of the service. There is no specific exemp tion provided to the\nabove said service. Hence, the same is taxable. As per the tariff under GST, the prescribed rate for\nthe above referred service is 5% (clarific ation issued  vide Circular No. 19/19/17 dated 20-11-2017).\nUnder the GST Act, the GST is leviable on the consideration for supply . As per the definition of the\nterm \"cons ideration\" given under section 2(31) of the APGST Act, consideration can be in the form\nof money or otherwi se. In the present case, the consideration is not just Rs. 15/- per quintal but also\nincludes bye products  viz., broken rice, bran and husk. Unlike the previous enactments, under the\nGST Act 2017, consideration need not be in the form of money but anything equivalent to money .\nThus, even the monetary value of the goods and services also will form part of consideration. In\ncase of \"Custom Milling of Rice\" (for short, \"CMR\"), price is not the sole consideration as the\nconsideration involv es something in the form other than the cash. Hence, section 15 cannot be\napplied to the above case.\n(c) As per rule 27 of the CGST/SGST Rules, where the supply or goods or services is for a\nconsideration not wholly in money , the value of the supply shall be the open market value of such\nsupply . It is further contended that the normative milling charges are fixed by the Tariff\nCommission of India duly considering the cost of milling and the value of the bye products, so that\nthe Government will not be at loss. In the instant case, the Comptroller and Audit General has\npointed out that the increase in cost of the bye products was not taken into consideration for fixing\nthe revised normative value of custom milling per quintal of paddy; thereby causing huge loss to\nthe State exchequer . The same was acknowledged by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and\nPublic Distribution, Government of India in the press note dated 8-12-2015. However , till date the\nTariff Commission of India has not revised the normative value. From all these, it is clear that the\nmilling charges are always fixed taking into consideration the value of bye products also. Since the\nnormative value was fixed way back in the year 2005, the assessment considering the value of bye\nproducts at the present values is justified.\n(d) The bye products may include some exempted products like husk. However , for the purpose of\ncalculation of consideration their value shall be taken. Hence, the petitioner's contention that the\nexempted goods are being taxed is not correct. It is true that as per the tariff under the GST, the\ncommodities like rice, broken rice and husk are exempted and bran is taxable one. However , the\nissue for consideration is whether the broken rice and husk which are the exempted commodities\nwill form part of the valuation. In this regard, it is pertinent to distinguish between the supply and\nconsideration. Supply is what is provided by the supplier and consideration is what he get in return.\nIn case of the cash transactions, usually the supply will be either goods or services whereas\nconsideration will be in the form of cash. However , in case of non-cash transactions, both the\nsupply and consideration could be goods or services, which transaction can be termed as\"exchange\" or \"barter\". It is further contended that since the milling is done by the petitioner , the\nprimary responsibility and liability for payment of the GST is with the petitioner , but not with 4th\nrespondent. The analogy of Rural Development Cess cannot be adopted in the instance case as it\nwas an accommodat ion made by the Government to pay cess directly to the Department instead of\nmillers.\n(e) It is submitted that though the petitioner has filed returns duly disclosing the turnover , however ,\nfailed to pay the tax thereon and hence, the assessment was taken up quantifying the tax liability .\nSection 74 of the APGST Act, 2017 will be applicable where the evasion is wilful and section 73\nwill be applicable where it is non-wil ful. In the instant case, since the petitioner has already\ndisclosed the turnover , but disputed the levy of tax, it is a bona fide mistake on his part and\naccordingly , the provisions of section 73 were invoked. The prices arrived at are existing market\nprices only and are not imaginary . The information was obtained from the Civil Supplies\nDepartment relates to the milling year 2017-18. Accordingly , the amounts received were taxed\nunder the provisions  of the GST Act only. The writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner has\ngot an ef fective and alternative remedy . Therefore, the writ petition maybe dismissed.\n4. Respondent No. 4 filed counter opposing the writ petition and contending thus:\n(a) It is submitted that the 4th respondent  has been procuring the Custom Mill Rice (CMR) under\nMinimum Support Price (MSP) operations and acts as a nodal agency to procure paddy through\nvarious agencies like PACS/V elugu/DCMS/GCC etc. and in turn the designated rice mills get the\npaddy and the respe ctive miller has to deliver resultant rice @ 67% for raw rice and 68% for boiled\nrice to APSCSCL/FCI at their designated godowns simultaneously .\n(b) As per clause 22 of the agreement, the mill shall retain all bye products such as broken, bran, husk\netc. derived during the process of milling, Income generated while selling by-products is concerned,\nthe mill shall be responsible to incur expenses and to pay taxes to the concerned departments. Thus,\nas per clause 22 of the agreement, the writ petitioner is liable to pay all the taxes to 1st respondent.\nThus, as per clause 9 of the agreement, the writ petitioner has to deliver 67% of raw rice and 68%\nof boiled rice to APSCSCL/FCI. The writ petitioner's raising objection regardin g the resultant rice\nof CMR coming to 61-62% is not correct. On the other hand, all the rice millers in the Andhra\nPradesh are supplying 67%/68% CMR to the respondent Corporation since the inception.\n(c) As per clause 31 of the agreement, both the parties have agreed that in the event of any dispute with\nregard to the agreement, the same shall be referred to the arbitrator and the arbitrator shall be\nappointed by VC & Managing Director of Corporation.\n(d) The appeal against the impugned order can be filed before the appellate authority . Instead of\napproaching the said authority the petitioner straight away filed the writ petition  and hence, the writ\npetition is liable to be dismissed in limine .\n(e) The 4th respondent herein need not pay any taxes payable to 1st respondent. It is the bounden duty\nof the writ petitione r to pay all the taxes  payable to the 1st respondent as per the agreement but not\nthe 4th respondent in view of Clause No. 22 of agreement. On that ground also, the writ petition is\nliable to be dismisse d. The writ petition  does not merit consideration and hence, the same maybe\ndismissed.\n5. Heard the arguments of learned Senior Counsel, Sri S. Ravi representing Sri G. Narendra Chetty , learned\ncounsel for petitioner , and learned Advocate General representing the respondents 1 to 3 and Sri\nHemachandra, learned Standing Counsel for the 4th respondent.\n6. Severely fulminatin g the impugned Assessment Order , learned Senior Counsel, Sri S. Ravi argued that the\n1st respondent who is the assessing authority wholly misconceived while applying the provisions of the GST\nAct to the terms of the CMR agreement  between the petitioner and 4th respondent and included the value of\nthe by-products to the actual consideration of Rs. 15/- per quintal paid to the petitioner towards milling\ncharges and held that the total considera tion in this case is not only Rs. 15/- per quintal but also the value of\nthe by-products and accordingly , wrongly assessed the GST on the aforesaid total value treating the same as\nconsideration. Learned Senior Counsel strongly professed that having regard to the intention of the parties and\nthe terms employed in the agreement, particularly Clause No. 22, there can not be even a slightest demur that\nthe by-products obtained on milling such as brokens, bran, husk etc. do not form part of the consideration formilling. Referring to Clause No. 22, learned Senior Counsel vehemently argued that the 4th respondent made\nit abundantly clear that the petitioner shall retain all by-products derived during  the process of milling. Had it\nbeen the intention of the parties that the by-products which were allowed to be retained by the petitioner\nshould form part of consideration, nothing prevented them to employ a suitable clause to that effect. On the\nother hand, it was simply mentioned that the mill (the petitioner) shall retain all by-products such as brokens,\nbran, husk  etc., derived during the process of milling. Of course, it is mentioned that the mill shall be\nresponsible to incur expenses and taxes on sale of by-products. This later part of the clause only implies that\non sale of these by-products, the petitio ner would be liable to pay GST treati ng the same as supply of the\ngoods, provided these by-products are taxable commodities under GST Act. In fact, the brokens and husk are\nexempt commodities and hence no GST  need to be paid and the petitioner on sale of bran to the third parties\ncollects GST at 5% and issues invoice to that effect. Learned Senior Counsel would argue that there is no\ndispute with regard to the later part of the clause i.e., with regard to the petitioner's liability to pay GST on the\nsale of by-products. However , such condition will not make the by-products as part of the consideration for\nmilling. He further argued that there was a valid purpose in 4th respondent's letting the petitioner to retain the\nby-products. As per terms of the agreement, irrespective of the yield on milling, the petitioner is liable to\ndeliver 67% of Custom Milled Rice against the paddy delivered to him. However , the yield will not be more\nthan 61% to 62%. Nevertheless, the petitioner shall replenish the shortfall of the yield of the rice and deliver\n67% of rice to 4th respondent. In that process, since the petitioner incurs loss, to compensate him, the 4th\nrespondent allowed him to retain the by-products and make good his loss by selling the by-products to third\nparties. Further , the 4th respondent being the State Government Corporation, has no wherewithal to store,\nmaintain and sell the by-products by its own. This reason also compelled the 4th respondent to permit the\npetitioner to retain the by-products. Therefore, the retention of by-products by the petitioner can only be\ntermed as \"compensation\" but not as \"consideration\" within the meaning of GST  Act. Learned Senior Counsel\nlamented that witho ut proper appreciation of these factual intricacies, the 1st respondent casually treated the\nby-products as part of the consideration.\n7. Finally , he reiterated that to resolve the issue whether the by-products form part of the consideration or\ncompensation, one has to necessarily read in between the terms of the agreement but shall not go by\nassumptions and presumptions. To buttress his argument, learned Senior Counsel placed reliance on Food\nCorporation of India  v. State of A.P 1997 SCC  Online AP 1143. He submitt ed that in the light of the above\njudgment, the assessment of the 1st respondent made on the basis of assumption is wholly without jurisdiction\nand authority and therefore the Writ Petition is maintainable in spite of the fact that the right of statutory\nappeal is available to the petitioner . He alternatively argued that in spite of his submission, if the Court comes\nto conclusion that the by-products shall also be treated as part of consideration  and exigible to GST, the tax\nliability maybe attached to 4th respondent being the recipient of the services, either directly or by\nreimbursement to the petitioner .\n8. In oppugnation, learned Advocate General argued that the Government of India, Ministry of Finance -\nDepartment of Revenue - Tax Research Unit in its letter F.No.354/263/2017-TR U dated 20-11-2017 addressed\nto the Officers of the Central Tax Departments, has given clarification on the taxability of Custom Milling of\nthe paddy . In the said letter , it was clarified that milling of paddy is not an intermediate production process in\nrelation to the cultiv ation of plants. Milling of paddy into rice is done by the Rice Millers and it changes its\nessential character . In that view , milling of paddy into rice is not eligible for exemption under S.No.55 of\nNotification 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28-6-2017 and such custom milling which is a job-work is\nliable to GST @ 5% on the processing charge. Therefore, the consideration received by a miller for Custom\nMilled Rice is exactable to GST. The learned Advocate General further argued that in the instant case the\npetitioner is a supp lier of the service of milling to the 4th respondent and for its services, it received\nconsideration partly in cash and partly in kind i.e., in the form of by-products. Learned Advocate General\nwould elucidate that the definition of the term \"consideration\" under section 2(31) of GST Act encompasses\nboth cash and kind.  Therefore, the 1st respondent has rightly treated the value of by-products as part of the\nconsideration and assessed to GST. Since Clause No. 22 of the agreement clearl y lays down that the petitioner\nis responsible to pay the tax on the by-products, the petitioner has to pay tax thereon as assessed.\n9. Distinguishing the Judgment in Food Corporation of India's case cited by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner , learned Advocate General argued that in that case, in the agreement between the Food Corporation\nof India and concern ed Miller , it was clearly mentioned that the by-products shall be the property of the agent\n(Miller). In that context, it was held that FCI did not bother itself regard ing the by-products and just\ntransferred the property to the agent and the agreement was silent as to whether the sale has taken place for\ncash or deferred payment or for other valuable consideration and hence the value of the by-products cannot beadded to the turnover of the FCI. Learned Advocate General vehemently argued that in the instant case at\nClause No. 22 except mentioning that the Mill (petitioner) shall retain all by-products, there is no mentioning,\nas we find in FCI's case, that the by-products shall be the property of the petitioner . He thus narrated that\nwhen by-products were not intended to be treated as the property of the petitioner free of cost, the obvious\nconclusion was that the petitioner shall retain them as part of the consideration.\n10. Nextly , learned Advocate General argued that as against the Assessment Order of the 1st respondent, a\nstatutory appeal is provided under section 107 of GST Act. Without availing the said efficacious alternative\nremedy , the petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under article 226 of Constitution of India.\nTherefore, the Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed in limine . To buttress his stand point of view , he placed\nreliance on_\nAssistant Commissioner  v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. [2020] 116 taxmann.com 417\n(SC)\nCommissioner of Income-tax  v. Chhabil Dass Agarw al [2013] 36 taxmann.com 36/217 Taxman 143/357\nITR 357 (SC)\nOrder dated 21-7-2020 in W .P.No.1 1819 of 2020 of High Court of Andhra Pradesh.\nHe thus, prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n11. Learned Standing Counsel for 4th respondent while toeing the line of learned Advocate General,\nadditionally argued that since an arbitration clause is made available in the agreement, the petitioner is not\nentitled to file writ petition.\n12. The point for consideration is:\nWhether the impugned assessment order levying GST on the estimated by-products value, treating such\nby-products as part of the considerati on for milling, is legally sustainable under the provisions of\nCGST/APGST Act, 2017 or not?\n13. POINT : As can be seen, Custom Milling Rice is an arrangement where the Government through the Civil\nSupplies Corporation gets the paddy milled into rice through the millers. For this purpose, the 4th respondent\nenters into an agreement with the millers incorporating therein the method and manner of milling the paddy .\nIn the above process , in the context of GST Act, the petitioner shall be regarde d as \"supplier\". Under section\n2(105) of GST Act, supplier in relation to any goods or services or both, shall mean the person supplying the\nsaid goods or services or both and shall include an agent as such on behalf of such supplier .\nThe petitioner , in view of undertaking the exercise of milling the paddy , offers \"services\" to 4th respondent\nwithin the meaning of section 2(102) of the GST Act. Similarly , the 4th respondent Corporation is called as\n\"recipient\" of services within the meaning of section 2(93) of GST Act.\nWhat the petitioner undertakes is \"job-work\" as per section 2(68). The term \"job-work\" means any treatment\nor process undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another registered person and the expression job-\nwork shall be construed accordingly .\nThe returns, which the petitioner gets out of milling is known as \"consideration\" within the meaning of\nsection 2(31) of GST Act. As per this provision, the consideration maybe either in the form of money or\notherwise.\n14. Be that it may, a doubt seems to have arisen as to whether custom milling of paddy by the rice millers for\nCivil Supplies Corporation is liable to GST or whether it is exempted under S.No.55 of Notification 12/2017-\nCentral Tax (Rate) dated 28-6-2017. In this regard, clarification was issued in F.No.354/263/2017-TRU by the\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance, in its letter dated 20-1 1-2017 to the Commercial T ax Department, a\ncopy of which is placed on record by learned Advocate General and it reads thus:\n3. Milling of paddy  is not an intermediate production process in relation to cultivation of plants. It is a\nprocess carried out after the process of cultivation is over and paddy has been harvested. Further ,\nprocessing of paddy into rice is not usually carried out by cultivators but by rice millers. Milling of paddy\ninto rice also changes its essential characteristics. Therefore, milling of paddy into rice cannot be\nconsidered as an intermediate production process in relation to cultivation of plants for food, fibre or\nother similar products or agricultural produce.4. In view of the above, it is clarified that milling of paddy into rice is not eligible for exemption under\nS.No.55 of Notification 12/2017-Cen tral Tax (Rate) dated 28th June 2017 and corresponding\nnotifications issued under IGST and UTGST Acts.\n5. GST rate on services by way of job-work in relation to all food and food products falling under\nChapters 1 to 22 has been reduced from  18% to 5% vide Notification No. 31/2017-CT(R) [Notification\nNo. 11/2017-CT (Rate), dated 28.06.17. S.No.26 refers]. Therefore, it is hereby clarified that milling of\npaddy into rice on job-work basis, is liable to GST at the rate of 5% on the processing charges (and not\non the entire value of rice).\n15. From the above clarification, it is clear that custom milling of paddy is not exempted and on the other\nhand, it is a taxable service and liable to GST @ 5% on the processing charges and not on the entire value of\nrice.\n16. To the above extent, there is no controversy . However , the bone of contention in this case is what\nconstitutes the 'consideration' for levy of GST. According to Revenue, not only the milling charges @ Rs. 15/-\nper quintal but also the by-products received by the petitioner constitute the consideration, whereas, the\ncontention of the petitioner is that by-products were just left by 4th respondent with the petitioner as they\nwere not useful to it, for, their disposal was not economically viable. Further , the by-products were left to the\npetitioner as compensation to replenish the shortfall of the rice to make 67% of yield on milling.\n17. In order to appreciate the above respective contentions and to know the nature and character of by-\nproducts, we should necessarily refer to the terms of the agreement. It is pertinent to mention here that in\nsimilar circumstances, in the case of Food Corporation of India  (1 supra ), a Division Bench of the High Court\nof Andhra Pradesh held that when the terms between the parties are under an agreement, those terms are\nsacrosanct and cannot be explained otherwise by adducing oral evidence. The facts in that case briefly are that\nthe FCI entered into agreements with different millers to whom it supplied paddy for the purpose of milling\nand paid hire charges and milling charges. As per the milling agreement, the FCI agreed to give the by-\nproducts such as broken rice, husk and bran to the millers. The Assessing Authority added the value of the by-\nproducts to the turnover of the FCI for the purpose of computation of Sales Tax, treating such by-products to\nhave been sold by the FCI to the millers. The contention of the FCI was that it just allowed the millers to treat\nthe by-products as their property but there was no sale between them and it did not receive any remuneration\nin that regard and therefore same cannot be added to its turnover . In that contex t, the Division Bench perused\nthe relevant term relating to by-products embodied in clause E( v) which is as follows:\n\"The by-products,  viz., broken rice, rice fragments, rice bran and husk, etc., obtained in the shelling of\npaddy shall be the property of the agent and these products shall not be the responsibility of the FCI.\nHowever , sales tax, if any on the value of such by-products will be recovered from the miller at the rate\nfixed by the appropriate Government and in force from time-to-time.\"\nAnalysing the above stipulation, the Division Bench observed thus:\n5. Since in the agreement the service charge is indicated as only Rs. 5 per quintal of paddy and nothing\nelse is indicated towards remuneration, there is no warrant to stipulate a further condition regarding\nremuneration, as has been done by the authorities under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act. It is\nwell-known that when the terms betwe en the parties are under an agreement, the terms are sacrosanct\nbetween them and that it can neither be varied or altered or explained otherw ise by adducing of oral\nevidence. ( Emphasis supplied ).\nClause E( v) does not speak of the by-products having been allowed as remuneration for milling. All that\nit says is that the by-products are not the responsibility of the petitioner and concedes that these by-\nproducts are the property of the agent. There is nothing to show that the transfer of property in the goods\nor the by-products to be by way of sale, but only indicates that the FCI does not concern or bother itself\nfor the broken rice, etc., for which it has no use and does not want to be burden ed with the clause would\nnot lead to the proof of there having been a sale. The transfer of property in the goods might take place\neven when there is no sale, say where there is a voluntary transfer or giftin g away of the goods in\nquestion.\n18. From the above, it percolates:\n(i) When the terms are entered in the form of a written agreement, the same are sacrosanct and shall belooked into know the purpose for which by-products were given to the miller and not by adducing\noral evidence.\n(ii) When the terms only specify a certai n amount as remuneration and nothing else is indicated\ntowards remuneration, no further condition can be regarded as remuneration.\n(iii) When the terms say that the by-products shall be the property of the agent (miller), such transfer of\nproperty in the goods cannot be treated as sale.\nIn the light of above jurisprudence, we have to meticulously analyse the terms of the agreement to know\nwhether in the instant case, the by-products assumed the character of 'consideration'.\n19. Alon g with the counter , the 4th respondent filed copy of agreement dated 18-12-2017 entered into by it\nwith the petitioner . The agreement contains 34 clauses meticulously incorporating therein, all the relevant\nterms relating to CMR. Clause No. 22 relates to by-products. It says:\n22. That the mill shall retain all by-prod ucts such as brokens, bran, husk etc., derived during the process\nof milling. The mill shall be responsible to incur expenses and taxes on sale of by-products.\nWith regar d to the payment of consideration i.e., milli ng charges, a separate clause i.e., Clause No. 17 is\nincluded which says:\n17. That the Corpora tion will pay milling charges as fixed by the GOI for the KMS 2017-18. The milling\ncharges are inclusive of transportation of paddy and rice upto a distance of 8 KMs and other incidentals\nupto delivery of rice to the FCI/Corporation godown.\nThus, as can be seen, the above two clauses couched in the agreement are distinct and independent to each\nother . Whereas, Clause No. 17 says that milling charges will be paid as fixed by the GOI (admittedly @\nRs.15/- per quintal), Clause No. 22 states that the mill shall retain all the by-products such as brokens, bran,\nhusk etc., derived during the process of milling. There is no slightest insinuation in either clause that the by-\nproducts shall form part of the consideration. If the parties to the agreement had such intention, nothing\nprevented them to do so. As we observe d, all the terms of CMR, both significant and trivial, are meticulously\nincorporated. For instance, it was mentio ned that the mill shall deliver raw rice - 67% and boiled rice - 68% as\nagainst the paddy delivered for CMR; the mill shall bear unloading charges, insurance, tarpaulin, ropes,\ndunnage material, prophylactic and curative treatment expenditure etc; the mill shall use SBT gunnies\nsupplied with paddy  stocks and shall return the left over gunnies to the corporation, failing which, 60% of the\ncost of the gunny will be collected from the mill etc. Going by the way the aforesaid terms are meticulously\nincorporated, one can logically conclude that, if the parties wanted to covenant that by-products shall form\npart of the considera tion, they would have mentioned in clear terms. Therefore, we have no demur to hold that\nthe absence of such mentioning is an indicative that the by-products which are allowed to be retained by the\npetitioner are not the part of the consideration. We cannot conjunct both the above clauses to bring the by-\nproducts into the purview of consideration.\n20. In the above context, the argument of learned Advocate General that since the later part of Clause No. 22\nordains that the petitioner shall be respo nsible to pay tax on sale of by-product s, the same shall be treated as\npart of consideration, cannot be counten anced. Treating the by-products as part of consideration and payment\nof tax on sale of by-products are two different aspects. The petitioner has to pay tax on sale of by-products (if\nthey are taxable), whether he receiv ed the by-products from 4th respon dent either towards part of\nconsideration or freely . Therefore, the later part of Clause No. 22 is not a determinative factor for holding that\nthe by-products are part of the consider ation. On the other hand, the submission of the petitioner that the by-\nproducts are given to the petitioner towards compensation appears to be logicall y correct. As per Clause No. 8\nthe petitio ner has to handover 67% of raw rice and 68% of boiled rice as against the paddy delivered to him\nfor milling . The submission of petition er is that the actual yield will be 61% to 62% only and he has to\nreplenish the shortfall by incurring expenditure and therefore to compensate him, the by-products were\nallowed to be retained by him free of cost. On a conspectus of the terms of agreement, we hold that the by-\nproducts form part of compensation but not consideration. We are constrained to hold that in the impugned\norder , the 1st respon dent erroneously concluded that the miller was allowed to retain the by-products towards\nconsideration, thoug h such import is impermissible from the terms of the agreement. Therefore, the impugned\norder to the extent of including the value of by-products to the milling charges and assessing tax is legally\nunsustainable.21. The objection of learned Advocate General regarding maintainability of Writ Petition in view of\navailability of alternative remedy is concerned, true that as against the impugned Assessment Order an appeal\nis provided under section 107 of GST Act. It is also true that this Court will not generally entertain writ when\nefficacious alternative remedy is available. However , since the facts in the present case are squarely covered\nby the ratio laid by the Division Bench in Food Corporation of India  (1 supra ) and the 1st respondent without\nconsidering the same committed legal error on sheer assumptions, we thought it apposite to entertain the writ\npetition instead of driving the petitioner to the Appellate Authority . In this regard , the decisions relied upon by\nlearned Advocate General can be distin guished. In Glaxo Smith Klina Consumer Health Cares Ltd. case (2\nsupra ), the question for consideration before Apex Court was whether the High Court in exercise of writ\njurisdiction ought to entertain a challenge to the Assessment Order on the sole ground that the statutory\nremedy of appeal against that order was foreclosed by the law of limitation . In that case, as against the\nAssessment Order dated 21-6-2017, the assessee filed a belated appeal on 24-9-2018 instead of within 30 days\nfrom the date of receipt of the order copy . The same was dismissed on 25-10-2018 being barred by limitation\nand also as no sufficient cause was made out. Thereafter , a writ petition was filed before High Court\nchallenging the Assessment Order dated  21-6-2017, but not the appellate order dated 25-10-2018. Ultimately ,\nthe writ petition was allowed setting aside the impugned Assessment Order dated 21-6-2017 and the assessee\nwas relegated before the Assessing Auth ority for consideration of the matter afresh after hearing the assessee.\nThe same was challenged by the Revenue before Apex Court. The Apex Court found fault with the order of\nthe High Court main ly for the reason that as per section 31 of A.P. Value Added Tax, 2005, an appeal could be\nfiled within 30 days from the date of receiving the order and the Appellate Auth ority can condone the delay in\nfiling appeal upto 30 days more and therefore, the Appellate Authority is not empowered to condone delay\nbeyond the aggregate period of 60 days from the date of the order , but the High Court without considering\nthese provisions,  set aside the original Assessment Order . The Apex Court observed thus:\n15. xxxx This approach is faulty . It is not a matter of taking away the jurisdictio n of the High Court. In a\ngiven case, the assessee may approach the High Court before the statutory period of appeal expires to\nchallenge the assessment order by way of writ petition on the ground that the same is without jurisdiction\nor passed in excess of jurisdiction - by overstepping or crossing the limits of jurisdiction including in\nflagrant disregard of law and rules of procedure or in violation of principles of natural justice, where no\nprocedure is specified. The High Court may accede to such a challenge and can also non-suit the\npetitioner on the ground that alternative efficacious remedy is available and that be invoked by the writ\npetitioner . However , if the writ petitioner choses to approach the High Court after expiry of the maximum\nlimitation period of 60 days prescribed under section 31 of the 2005 Act, the High Court cannot disregard\nthe statuto ry period  for redressal of the grievance and entertain the writ petition of such a party as a\nmatter of course. Doing so would be in the teeth of the principle underlying the dictum of a three-judge\nBench of this Court  in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (supra ). In other  words, the fact that the\nHigh Cour t has wide powers, does not mean that it would issue a writ which maybe inconsistent with the\nlegislative intent regarding the dispensa tion explicitly prescribed under section 31 of the 2005 Act. That\nwould render the legislative scheme and intention behind the stated provision otiose .\nIn the case on hand , the Assessment Order was passed 29-10-2018 and as per section 107 of GST Act, an\nappeal shall be filed within three (3) months from the date of communication of the order . The Writ petition is\nfiled on 17-12-2018 i.e., well within the period of limitation for filing appeal. Having regard to the dictum laid\nin Glaxo Smith's  case (2 supra ), this Court can either entertain the writ petition or refer the petitioner to\nAppellate authority . Since the impugned order was passed having no regard to the law laid down in the case of\nFood Corp oration of India  (1 supra ), the writ was enter tained. For the same  reason, the other decisions relied\nupon by learned Advocate General are not followed.\n22. The objection raise d by learned counsel for the 4th respondent that in view of the arbitration clause, the\nwrit petiti on is not maintainable, has no teeth. It should be noted that there  are no disputes between the\npetitioner and the 4th respondent with regard to the implementation of the terms of the agreement. On the\nother hand , the dispute is between the Revenue and the petitioner as to whethe r or not the by-products form\npart of the considera tion. Since such a dispute cannot be referred to and resolv ed by the Arbitrator , the Writ\nPetition is very much maintainable.\n23. In the result, this Writ Petition is allowed and the impugned Assessment Order passed by the 1st\nrespondent  vide Ref. No. CGST/2017-18/05 dated 29-10-2018 insofar as it relates to the levy of GST on the\nvalue of by-products i.e., broken rice, bran and husk treating them as part of the consideration paid to the\npetitioner for milling of the paddy , is set aside. No costs.JYOTIAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , shall stand closed."}

With the consent of both learned counsel, this petition is decided at this stage.\n3. Time was granted to obtain instructio ns on the point as mentioned in the order dated 13-12-2023, in\nparticular with respect to the discrepancies mentioned in the impugned order which reference to the\npetitioner's reply dated 4-2-2022 and also that no reply was filed. The order dated 13-12-2023 reads as\nfollows:\n\"Learned counsel for the petitioner subm its that the order of cancellation  of the petitioner's registration  of\nGST dated 25-1-2022 which is impugned in this petition along with appellate order by which the appeal\nwas also dismissed beyond the period of limitation and the condonable period does not assign any reason\nfor such cancellation .\n2. He further submi ts that though the show cause notice was given stating the reason for the proposed\ncancellation  to which the petitioner could not file the reply , but still a valid reason for cancellation  is tobe assigned in the order . He further submits that reason as assigned in the show cause notice, is not\ncovered under section 29 of GST Act for cancellation .\n3. We find that the impugned order (Ex.P3) in the first line mentions \"this has reference to your reply\ndated 4-2-2022 in response to the notic e to show cause dated 25-1-2022\". When it is admitted, that the\npetitioner did not file any response to the show cause notice, as to how the said fact was mentioned in the\nimpugned order . Further , the second line in the impugned order mentions that \"whereas no reply to notice\nto show cause has been submitted\". In our view it cannot be that the reply was filed and was also not\nfiled. The said prima facie  shows non application of mind in passing the impugned order , which also\ndoes not assign any reason for cancellation .\n4. Learned counsel for the respondents prays time to obtain instructions.\n5. Post on 18-12-2023.\"\n4. The admitted fact by the petitioner is that reply was not filed by the petitioner to the show cause notice.\n5. Learned Government Pleader also submits today that no reply was filed and there is mistak e which is a\nclerical mistake, in the impugned order that the reply dated 4-2-2022 was filed.\n6. By the impugned order , the petitioner's registration  of GST had been cancelled  on 11-3-2022. Prior thereto,\nthe petitio ner was issued show cause notice dated 25-1-2022 on the following ground \"filing  nil returns\ncontinuously for more than 6 months\". The petitioner's appeal against the order dated 11-3-2022 which was\nfiled beyond the condonable delay period was rejected by the order dated 6-11-2023. Challenging the said\norders, the present writ petition has been filed.\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the impugned order , ground of cancellation  is not\nmentioned. He further submits that in the show cause notice, the ground for proposed cancellation  as\nmentioned, \"filing  nil returns  continuously for more than 6 months\" does not fall under any of the clauses\nunder section 29 of the Goods and Services T ax Act nor under Rule 22 of the GST Rules.\n8. Learned Government Pleader submits that the appeal was filed with delay beyond the condonable delay\nperiod and consequently , the dismissal of the appeal on the ground of delay cannot be faulted.\n9. We have considered the submissions advanced and have perused the material on record.\n10. Section 29 of GST Act relating to Cancellation  or suspension of registration  reads as under:\n\"29. Cancellation  or suspension of registration :\n1. The proper officer may, either on his own motion or on an application filed by the registered person or\nby his legal heirs, in case of death of such person, cancel  the registration , in such manner and within such\nperiod as may be prescribed, having regard to the circumstances where,-\n(a) the business has been discontinued, transferred fully for any reason including death of the\nproprietor , amalgamated with other legal entity , demer ged or otherwise disposed of; or\n(b) there is any change in the constitution of the business; or\n(c) the taxable person is no longer liable to be registered under section 22 or section 24 or\nintends to opt out of the registration  voluntarily made under sub-section (3) of section 25.\nProvided  that during pendency of the proceedin gs relating to cancellation  of registration  filed by the\nregistered person, the registration  may be suspended for such period and in such manner as may be\nprescribed.\n(2) the proper officer may cancel  the registration  of a person from such date, including any retrospective\ndate, as he may deem fit, where,-\n(a) a registered person has contravened such provisions of the Act or the rules made\nthereunder as may be prescribed; or\n(b) a person paying tax under section 10 has not furnished the return  for a financial year\nbeyond three months from the due date of furnishing the said return ; or(c) any registered person, other than a perso n specified in clause( b), has not furnished returns\nfor such continuous tax period as may be prescribed; or\n(d) any person who has taken voluntary registration  under sub-section (3) of section 25 has not\ncommenced business within six months from the date of registration ; or\n(e) registration  has been obtained by means of fraud, willful misstatement or suppression of\nfacts:\nProvided  that the proper officer shall not cancel  the registration  without giving the person an opportunity\nof being heard:\nProvided Further  that during penden cy of the proceedings relating to cancellation  of registration , the\nproper of ficer may suspend the registration  for such period and in such manner as may be prescribed.\"\n11. Rule 22 of the Central Goods and Services T ax Rules, 2017 reads as follows:\n\"22. Cancellation  of registration :\n1. Where the proper officer has reasons to believe that the registration  of a person is liable to\nbe cancelled  under section 29, he shall issue a notic e to such person in FORM GST REG-\n17, requiring him to show cause, within a period of seven working days from the date of\nthe service of such notice, as to why his registration  shall not be cancelled .\n2. The reply to the show cause notice issued under sub-rule (1) shall be furnished in FORM\nREG-18 within the period specified in the said sub-rule.\n3. Where a person who has submitted an application for cancellation  of his registration  is no\nlonger liable to be registered or his registration  is liable to be cancelled , the proper officer\nshall issue  an order in FORM GST REG-19, within a period of thirty days from the date of\napplication submitted under sub-rule (1) of rule 20 or, as the case may be, the date of the\nreply to the show cause issued under sub-rule (1), cancel  the registration , with ef fect from a\ndate to be determined by him and notify the taxable person, directing him to pay arrears of\nany tax, interest or penalty including the amount liable to be paid under sub-section (5) of\nsection 29.\n4. Where the reply furnished under sub-rule (2) is found to be satisfactory , the proper officer\nshall drop the proceedings and pass an order in FORM GST REG-20.\n5. The provisions of sub-rule (3) shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to the legal heirs of a\ndeceased proprietor , as if the application had been submitted by the proprietor himself.\"\n12. It is evident from the bare reading of sub section (2) and Section 29 of the Act that the registration  could\nbe cancelled  by appropriate officer on any of the grounds mentioned under sub-section (2). In the present case\nthe ground of cancellation  is that the petitioner filed nil returns  continuou sly for more than six mont hs.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner submits that since the returns  were Nil, the nil returns  were filed.\n13. Section 29(2) does not contain any such ground for cancelation . In the Rules also there is no such ground\nfor cancellation .\n14. In the show cause notice or in the order it is not the case of the respondents that the 'nil returns ' were filed\nincorrectly , contravening any provision of the GST Act or the Rules.\n15. We are of the view that the impugned order of cancelation  is without jurisdicti on and without any valid\nstatutory ground. The same cannot be sustained.\n16. So far as the submission of the learned Government Pleader that the appellate order does not suffer from\nany illegality because after the condonable period of delay , the appellate authority has no jurisdiction to\ncondone the delay and has to dismiss the appeal, is concerned since both the orders are under challenge and\nwhen the first order is without jurisdicti on, the appellate order dismissing the appeal, may be on any ground,\ncan also not be sustained.\n17. In the result, the writ petition is allowed.

Durga  Prasad Rao, J. - In this Writ Petition the petitioner challenges the provisional  attachment  order\ndated 1-4-2022 and 6-4-2022 issued under Form GST DRC - 22 by the 4th respondent as illegal, arbitrary andto set aside  the same and pass such other orders deemed fit.\n2. Petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a company engaged in the business of iron scrap and during the course of search\noperations conducte d by the respondent  authorities U/s 67 of A.P. Goods & Service Tax Act, (for\nshort 'AP GST Act, 2017') on 31-3-2022, the respondent authorities seized the books of accounts\nand issued  summons directing the Director and employees of the petitioner company U/s 70 of the\nAP GST Act, 2017 and accordingly the deponent of the writ affidavit and the employees of the\npetitioner company attended the enquiry and their statements were recorded. Thereafter by way of\nimpugned provisional  orders of attachment  the accounts of the petitioner maintained with the\nrespondents 6 and 7 banks have been provisionally  attached . Challenging such attachment , the writ\npetition is filed.\n(b) It should be noted that in I.A.No.1 of 2022 the petitioner sought for interim suspension of the\nprovisional  attachment  orders dated 1-4-2022 and 6-4-2022. This Court heard learned counsel for\nthe petitio ner Sri Bhaskar Reddy Vemi Reddy and Sri Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Government\nPleader for respondents. Learned counsel for the petitioner mainly raised the following two\ncontentions before this Court:\n(1) The 4th respondent herein in the impugn ed orders of provisional  attachment  did not record\nanything with regard to the formation of opinion or subjective satisfaction and the same is\ncontrary to the provisions of Section 83 of the Act.\n(2) As on the date of the orders of provisional  attachment , there were no proceedings pending\nunder section 67 of the Act nor any proceedings have been initiated either under section 73\nor 74 of the Act.\nAnd to buttress the above contentions, the petitioner relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nRadha Krishan Industries  v. State of Himachal Pradesh  AIR 2021  SC 2114 = MANU/SC/0293/2021/ [2021]\n127 taxmann.com 26/48 G.S.T .L. 113/86 GST 665 and judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Anjani Impex  v.\nState of Gujarat  2020 [43] G.S.T .L. 23 = MANU/GJ/1423/2020/ [2020] 122 taxmann.com 299 . Learned\nGovernment Pleader resisted the writ petition and also interim application  contending that there was\nabsolutely no illegality nor any procedural infirmity in the impugned action. He further contended that only\nafter recor ding valid reasons in the note file and with an intention to protect the interest of Government\nrevenue, the 4th respondent issued impugned provisional  order of attachment  of the bank accoun ts of the\npetitioner . He thus opposed the writ petition as well as the interim application. This Court passed an elaborate\norder with the following observations:\n\"Admittedly , except  saying that the orders of provisional  attachment  are passed in order to protect the\ninterest of the Government revenue, no other reasons are assigned by the fourth respondent in the\nimpugned orders of the provisional  attachment . When sub-Rule (5) of Rule 159 of the Rules specifically\nprovides for filing objections  against the orders of provisional  attachment , the conte ntion that the reasons\nfor ordering provisional  attachment  were recorded in the Note File and that there is no need to extract the\nsame or state the same in the provisional  order of attachment , in the considered opinion of this Court,\ncannot stand for judicial scrutiny . The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the above referred judgment, also\ncategorically ruled that the formation of opinion on the basis of tangible material which indicates the\nnecessity to order provisional  attachment  to protect the interest of the Government revenue is mandatory .\nUnless reasons are recorded broadly , the assessee cannot be expected to file any objections  under the\nprovisions of sub-Rule (5) of Rule 159 of the Rules. The Ho'ble Supreme Court, in the above referred\njudgment, held that exercise of unguided discretion under section 83 of the Act would not be permissible\nas it will leave citizens and their legitimate business activities to the peril of arbitrary power . Having\nregard to the language employed by the legislature in Section 83 of the Act and Rule 159(5) of the Rules\nand the judgments referred to supra , this Court is of the opinion that the fourth respondent failed to\nadhere to the mandatory  requirement of formation of opinion. It is also the submission of the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner that, by pressing into service the provisions of Section 67 of the Act, the\nrespondent authorities conducted inspection, search and seizure. It is also submitted by the learned\ncounsel that, pursuant to the summons issued under section 70 of the Act, the Director and the employees\nappeared before the competent authority  and their statements were also recorded and the documents were\nalso seized. It is further submitted that, in view of the same, it cannot be said that the proceedings undersection 67 of the Act are pending. In order to show that the respondents have concluded proceedings\nunder section 67 of the Act, a copy of the order of seizure  vide  Form GST INS-02 under Rule 139(2) of\nthe Rules is filed as a material paper .\nOn the other hand, it is submitted by the learned Government Pleader that the provisional  orders of\nattachment  were communicated to the petitioner and the proceedings under section 67 of the Act are still\nincomplete and are pending.\nIn view of the above reasons, having regard to the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner\nand the judgments referred to above, this Court is of the opinion that the petiti oner has made out prima\nfacie  case for grant of interim relief.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, there shall be interim suspension of the provisional  attachment  orders, dated 1-\n4-2022 and 6-4-2022, till 15-7-2022.\nPost the matter for hearing on 5-7-2022.\"\n3. It should be noted that subsequently the 4th respondent filed counter affidavit alleging that on specific\nintelligence information that M/s RP Enterprises, M/s AR Traders, and M/s AN Traders have been passing on\nfake Input Tax Credit without actually purchasing goods in favour of the petitioner Company , investigation\nwas taken  up under the provisions of AP GST Act, 2017 and during the course  of study of records available\nwith the Departmen t, it came to light that 90% of the input supplies of the petitioner company , were received\nfrom the aforesaid three firms but there were no corresponding purchases of scrap by the said three input\nsuppliers and theref ore the Special Commissioner , APSDRI has ordered for conducting searches at different\nlocations under the provisions of Sectio n 67 of the APGST Act, 2017. During  such search of the aforesaid\nthree trade rs it was identified that no such firms in existence at the given addres s. Accordingly , searches at the\nprincipal place of business of the petitioner along with the residential premises of the Managing Director of\nthe petitioner company were also conducted in the presence of independent witnesses. Since the investigation\nrevealed that the location of the business premises of the input suppliers of the petitioner Company are fake\nand since the input tax credit passed on by them is irregular , considering the quantum of irregularly availed\nITC, it was considered essential to provisionally  debit freeze the bank account of the petitioner company till\ncompletion of the investigation of the subject case and accordingly orders  vide  DRC-22, dated 1.04.02022 and\n6-4-2022 were issued U/s 83 of the APGST Act, 2017 to respondents 6 and 7 banks.\n4. In the counter , it is further submitted that ultimately investigation was completed and revised assessment\norder was passed U/s 74 of the APGST  Act, 2017 on 6-6-2023 confirming the demand of Rs. 21,58,53,496/-\nagainst the petitioner company along with the penalties.\n5. It is contended that Section 83 authorizes the provisional  attachment  not only during the pendency of any\nproceedings U/s 62 or 63 or 64 or 67 or 73 or Section 74 but \"after initiation of any proceeding under Chapter\nXII, Chapter XIV or Chapter XV\". Presently the case is under Chapter XV of APGST Act, 2017 and hence\nthe action of the respondents is legally tenable. It is further contended that the proceedings under order DRC-\n22 was issued with the following reasons:\n(a) None of the input suppliers were operating at the declared addresses;\n(b) Addresses provided by the input suppliers was fake address;\n(c) The whereabouts of the proprietors input supplier firms are unknown to the Department.\n(d) The Managing Director of the petitioner company is able to contact the proprietors of these fake\nfirms;\n(e) The petitioner company is able to contact the proprietors of these fake firms and make bank\ntransfers to the bank accounts of these fake firms;\n(f) That no record pertaining to the petitioner company were not available in their business/residential\npremises;\n(g) That even on the day of the search i.e., 31-3-2022, the petitioner company has issued E-Waybills\nfor a total value of Rs. 1,44,43,260/-, thereby passing on suspected irregular ITC of Rs. 25,99,787/-\nto their clients;AJAY(h) That the amounts transferred from the petitioner company to the fake input supplier firms were\nsubsequently diverted to individuals/firms/companies which have no declared business dealings\nthem\n6. It is further contended, reasons for action U/s 83 of the APGST Act r/w DRC-22 were sent to the petitioner\nby post. It is further submitted that the petitioner did not approach the Court with clean hands and as per the\nbank statements, in ICICI bank the petitioner has Rs. 1,42,24,933/- and in Axis Bank the petitioner has Rs.\n1,81,025/-whereas the tax liability of the petitioner as per the Assessment Order is Rs. 21,58,53,496/-. Thus\nthe funds available in the bank account  do not even meet the requirement of the 10% of the appeal amount.\nThe respondent thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n7. Heard Sri Bhaskar Reddy V emi Reddy , learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Y .N. V ivekananda, learned\nGovernment Pleade r for respondents. Both the learned counsel reiterated their pleadings in their respective\narguments.\n8. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow?\n9. POINT : As can be seen, in the interim order passed in I.A No. 1 of 2022 this Court in the light of the\nprinciples laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Radha Krishan Industries  (supra)  and judgment of the\nGujarat High Court in Anjani Impex  (supra) , observed  that in the orders of the 4th respondent, except saying\nthat provisional  attachment  orders were issued in order to protect the interest of the Government revenue,  no\nreasons were assigned in the provisional  attachment  order. This Court observed, when sub-Rule (5) of Rule\n159 of the Rules specifically provides for filing objections  against the orders of provisional  attachment , the\ncontention that the reasons for ordering provisional  attachment  were  recorded in the Note File and that there is\nno need to extract the same or state the same in the provisional  order of attachment , cannot stand for judicial\nscrutiny . It is further observed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above referred judgment also categorically\nruled that the formation of opinion on the basis of tangible material which indicates the necessity to order\nprovisional  attachment  to protect the interest of the Government revenue is mandatory . It is further observed\nthat unles s reasons are recorded broadl y, the assessee cannot be expected to file any objections  under the\nprovisions of Rule 159(5) of the Rules. This Court further observed that as per the aforesaid judgment of\nHon'ble Supreme Court the exercise of unguided discretion under section 83 of the Act would not be\npermissible as it will leave citizens and their legitimate business activities to the peril of arbitrary power . In\nthe interim  order this Court opined that the 4th respondent failed to adhere to the mandatory  requirement of\nformation of opinion. On such observations this Court passed the interim order .\n10. In our considered view , even after filing of the counter by the respondents, there is no scope to reverse the\nopinion expressed by this Court in the interim order . No doubt in the counter it is claimed by the respondents\nthat order  DRC-22 under section 83 was issued with the above extracted (a) to (h) reasons. However , on\nperusal of the provisional  attachment  order dated 1-4-20 22 issued by the 4th respondent under Form GST\nDRC 22 r/w Rule 159(1), it does not contain any reasons except mentioning  that in order to protect the\ninterest of the revenue and in exercise of the powers conferred U/s 83 of the Act the said order was issued.\nNeedles to emphasize that reasons are live-nerve of any order of the public authority , without which the\neffected party cannot effectively oppose  and submit his stand. Thus, in essence the reason given by this Court\nfor passing interim order holds good even in the main writ petition also. The averments in the counter and\npassing of the assessment order will not improve the case of respondents in the main writ petition to uphold\nthe provisional  attachment  order passed by the 4th respondent. Therefore, the writ petition deserves to be\nallowed.\n11. Accordingly , the writ petition is allowed and the impugned proceedings in Form GST DRC-22 Ref. No.\n:APSDRI/T1/GST/INT/06/2022, dated 1-4-2022 and Form GST DRC-22 Ref. No.\nAPSDRI/T1/GST/INT/06/2022, dated 6-4-2022 issued by the 4th respondent are hereby set aside.

Siddharth Reddy  for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Pao, J.- The petitioner prays for writ of mandamus declaring the action of the 1st\nrespondent in cancelling the registration  of the petitioner under CGST/APGST Act, 2017 as illegal, arbitrary ,\nhighhanded and vitiated on account of violation of principles of natural justice and violative of Articles 19 and\n21 of the Constitution of India and consequently set aside the impugned procee dings of the 1st respondent in\nForm GST REG-19, dated 15.07.2023 and pass such other orders deemed fit in the circumstance of the case.\n2. The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a proprietary concern engaged in the business of purchase and sale of iron scrap andpetitioner is registered with GSTIN No. 37BNHPR1 107A1ZG on the rolls of 1st respondent. The\npetitioner has been regularly filing monthly returns and making payment of taxes as per GST Act,\n2017 after availing ITC.\n(b) While so, 1st respondent issued a show cause notice dated 23.06.2023 U/s 29 of SGST Act r/w Rule\n21 of CGST Rules, 2017 proposing to cancel the registration of the petitioner on the alleged ground\nthat the suppliers of the goods to the purchaser has availed ITC without actual receipt of goods and\nindulged in passing on such credit to the petitioner without supply of goods. The 1st respondent, in\nthis regard relied on certain alleged reports allegedly received by him in respect of few suppliers by\nthe respec tive GST authorities. However , the petitioner was not supplied the reports allegedly sent\nby respective GST authorities of the suppliers of the petitioner . In spite of his obligation under law\nto supply all the incriminating material  along with show cause notice to enab le the petitioner to\nrespond in an effective manner even the allegations leveled in the show cause notice were also not\ncorrect. They are baseless and contrary to the Assessment Order .\n(c) In respons e to the show cause notice, the petitioner filed a detailed objection s dated 30.06.2023\ndisputing the allegations made in the show cause notice and requested to drop the proposed action.\nPetitioner contended that if for argume nt sake the allegations of fake invoices and claim of ITC\nwithout movement of goods as alleged by the 1st respondent is admitted to be true and consequently\nthere is no purchase  of goods by the petitioner , equally there cannot be any sale of goods by the\npetitioner , inasmuch  as, without inward receipt of goods, there cannot be outw ard sale of goods.\nThus, if the 1st responde nt disbelieves the purchases, he should equally disbelieves the sales.\nHowever , without considering all these aspects, the 1st respondent passed the impugned order dated\n15.07.2023 cancelli ng the registration of the petitioner on untenable ground s and also on the\ngrounds which were not raised in the show cause notice. The impugned order is in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice as the alleged reports issued by the GST authorities which are the basis\nfor issuing show cause notice were not supplied to the petitioner . It is further submitted that since\nthe petitioner was not properly advised,  he could not file a petition U/s 30 of CGST Act, 2017 for\nrevocation of registration.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. Heard arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Reddy and learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T axes for respondents.\n4. The pivotal argument of learned coun sel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Reddy is that the petitioner\nnever indulged in bogus purchases or supplies to accommodate his suppliers to claim ITC fraudulently . While\nissuing show cause notice, the 1st responden t who claims to have relied on certain reports allegedly submitted\nto him by certain GST Authorities, has not forwarded those reports to inform the petitioner with which of the\ndealers the petitioner made bogus trans actions to facilitate them to claim ITC wrongfully , so as to give an\nopportunity to the petitioner to submi t an effective reply . Learned counsel thus vehemently argued that\nprinciples of natural justice have been violated and therefore the impugned order liable to be set aside.\n5. Per contra, learne d Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes argued that the writ petition is not\nmaintainable, inasm uch as, the petitioner has alternative remedy to file a petiti on U/s 30 of APGST Act for\nrevocation of cancellation or to file an appeal against the impugned order before the Appellate Authority U/s\n107 of the APGST Act. Learned Government Pleader argued that without pursuing the alternative reliefs the\npetitioner cannot file the writ petition. Nextly , learned Government Pleader argued that the show cause notice\nis self-explanatory as the show cause notice contains the particulars of the non-existent dealers from whom\nthe petitio ner obtain ed bogus invoices and therefore the petitioner cannot claim non-supply of material and\nviolation of principles of natural justice. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow ?\n7. POIN T: As can be seen, the prime contention of learned Government Pleader is that since the petitioner has\nan alternat ive remedy U/s 30 of GST Act to file an application for revocation of cancellation or to assail the\nimpugned order in the appeal U/s 107 of GST Act, the writ petition is not maintainable. Per contra, the\ncontention of the petitioner is that required particulars are not furnished in the show cause notice dated\n23.06.2023 and thereby principles of natural justice have been violated and therefore, the writ petition ismaintainable. Law is no more res-integr a with regard to the maintainability of writ petition when alternative\nremedy is available to a party . In Whirlpool Corporation v . Registrar of T rade Marks, Mumbai 1998 (8) SCC 1\n= MANU/SC/0664/1998 the Apex Court has observed thus:\n\"14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is\nnot limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not\nonly for issuing writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, prohibition, Qua Warranto and\nCertiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution\nbut also for \"any other purpose\".\n15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has\ndiscretion to entertain or not to enterta in a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself\ncertain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court\nwould not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been  consistently held by this\ncourt not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely , where the Writ Petition has been filed\nfor the enforcement of any of the Funda mental rights or where there has been a violation of the principle\nof natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act\nis challen ged. Ther e is a plethora of case law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic\nwhirlpool we would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they\nstill hold the field.\"\n8. Thus , Hon'ble Apex  Court held that in certain contingencies viz., when writ petition is filed for enforcement\nof fundamental rights, or where there  has been a violation of principles of natural justice or when the\nproceedings impugned are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an act is challenged, the writ petition\ncould be maintainable in spite of availability of alternative remedy . In the instant case the petitioner banks\nupon the violation of principles of natur al justice to maintain the writ petition. In this context, a perusal of the\nshow cause notice dated 23.06.2023 shows that the 1st respondent has given required particulars of the non-\nexistent tax payers from whom the petitioner allegedly obtained bogus tax invoices. Therefore, we do not find\nvenom in the conte ntion of the petitioner that the show cause notice is bereft of required particulars and\nthereby the principles of natural justice  were violated. Admittedly , the petitio ner has alternative remedy to\nchallenge the impugned order which he did not avail. Therefore, we does not deserve any order in the writ\npetition. However , considering that the petitioner's registration has been cancelled and thereby he cannot\ncontinue his business activities, we deem  it apposite to give an opportunity to the petitioner to challenge the\nimpugned order either by way of filing a petition U/s 30 of the GST Act or to file an appeal within a\nreasonable time.\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is dismissed.

Suri Babu, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Shreyas Reddy ,\nlearned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax for the respondents.\n2. This writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed for the following relief:-\n\"Pleased for the aforesaid reasons, the petitioner prays that this Honble Court may be pleased to issue a\nWrit or order or direction particularly one in the nature of Writ of Mandamus setting aside the Order for\nCancellation of Registration passed by the first respondent in Form GST REG-19  vide Ref No.\nZA3706230276695 dated 16-6-2023 as arbitrary , illegal, against Principles of Natural Justice, contrary to\nthe provisions of the CGST Act, 2017/A PGST Act 2017, and contrary to the Judicial pronouncements of\nthis Hon'ble Court on the selfsame subject and to pass.\"3. Learned Governme nt Pleader has receiv ed instructions. However , inspite of opportunity granted  vide order\ndated 16-2-2024, the counter af fidavit has not been filed.\n4. Considering the nature of the controv ersy and the submissions advanced, no fruitful purpose would be\nserved in keeping the petition pending.\n5. The challenge is to the order dated 16-6-2023 of cancellation of the petitioner's registration of GST.\nPreviously show cause notice dated 8-5-2023 was given to the petitioner to which no reply was filed.\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner subm its that the petitioner could not submit the reply to the show cause\nnotice as the person who is handling the GST matter of the petitioner's firm left abruptly and petitioner was\nnot aware  of the issuance of the said show cause notice. He further submits that the managing partner of\npetitioner's firm i.e., the deponent, was not able to concentr ate on the business operations as he was attacked\nwith paralytic stroke. He submits that the order is in the violation of principles of natural justice.\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the impugned order also suf fers from non-application\nof mind. The petitioner admittedly could not submit any reply but the order mentions that \"whereas reply to\nthe show cause notice has been submitted  vide ARN Not available\".\n8. The Cancellation of the petitioner's registration certificate is on the ground that the petitioner did not submit\nthe returns for the period from September , 2022 to November , 2023 under section 29(2) of CGST Act, 2017.\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that petitioner has already paid amount of Rs. 13,26,788/-\n(P5) towards the dischar ge of his liability and he is also ready to file the returns for activation of registration\ncertificate. But in view of the order of cancellation, it is not possible to do so.\n10. Learned Government Pleader submits that he has instructions to submit that if the petitioner files the\nreturns, his GST registration can be restored.\n11. Learned Government Pleader further submits that though the impugned order  mentions that the reply to\nthe show cause notic e has been submitte d but it is also mentioned that vide 'ARN Not Available'. He submits\nthat, that means that the reply is not submitted and consequently the argument of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the order suf fers from non application of mind is unsustainable.\n12. We have considere d the submissions of the learned counsels for the parties and perused the material on\nrecord.\n13. Admitted ly, the petitioner did not file reply to the show cause notice we find force in the submission of the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner that the order suffers from non - application of mind and has been passed\nmechanically . It is reflective from the order itself a part of which reads as under:\n\".......\nThis has reference to show cause notice issued dated 8-5-2023.\nWhereas reply to the show cause notice  has been submitted vide ARN NOT AVAILABLE; and whereas,\nthe undersigned on examination of your reply to show cause notice and based on record available with\nthis of fice is of the opinion that your registration is liable to be cancelled for following reason( s):\nSection 29(2)( c) - Person, other than paying tax u/s 10, failed to furnish returns for prescribed periods.\n.......\"\n14. In para-4 of the affidavit the petitioner has specifically stated the reason for not filing the reply before the\nauthority , i.e., the same reasons as argued before us and mentioned in para 6 of this (supra ) judgment. On the\nsaid point there is no contrary instructio ns to the learned Government Pleader . Any counter affidavit denying\nthe averments in para-4, of the writ affidavit, has not been filed inspite of oppo rtunity granted. The petitioner\nhas also annexed documents (P3) in support of para 4 of the writ affidavit. We have no reason to disbelieve\nthe same. Consequently , we are of the view that the cause shown for not being  able to file the reply to show\ncause notice is sufficient. The petitioner deserves opportunity of hearing to be granted in consonance with the\nprinciples of natural justice.\n15. Considering overall facts and for the aforesaid reasons, we allow the writ petitio n and quash the impugned\norder dated 16-6-2023 with further direction that, pursuant to the show cause notice dated 8-5-2023(P2), the\npetitioner shall submit the reply within a period of three (03) weeks from the date of receipt of copy of thisRITAorder , along with the copy of this order to the competent authority , who shall pass appropriate orders afresh\nwithin the further period of three (03) weeks in accordance with law, keepin g in view that petitioner has\nalready paid an amount of Rs. 13,26,788/- (P5) and is also ready to file the returns.\n16.

With the consent of learned counsels for the parties, the present writ petition is being decided finally at this\nstage.\n3. The petitioner's GST registration was cancelled by order dated 13-3-2023 after show cause notice dated 14-\n1-2023. The petitioner filed appeal under section 107 of Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017\n(for short 'APGST Act') which was rejected at the admission stage on the ground that it was barred by\nlimitation and beyond the condonable statutory period.\n4. The appeal was beyond the condonable period by 128 days. Under Section 107 of APGST Act, the appeal\nwas to be filed within a period of limitation, in the present case, three months. The condonable periodAJAYthereafter was one month. The appellate authority under the statutory provision has no power to condone the\ndelay beyond the condonable statutory period. Consequently , the appeal was rejected.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the cause of the delay in not preferring the appeal within the\nstatutory period as also the condonable period was that the petitioner's health was not good and he was on bed\nrest. In this regard para Nos.4 & 7 of the af fidavit have been referred.\n6. The learned counse l for the petitioner has placed reliance in W.P.No.17349 of 2023 decided on 4-8-2023, in\nwhich a Coordinate  Bench of this Court, after finding that the sufficient cause was shown to condone the\ndelay in filing the appeal, remitted the matter to the appellate authority , by imposing the condition for\npayment of Rs. 20,000/-.\n7. Learned Governme nt Pleader for Commercial Tax submits that considering the judgment of the coordinate\nBench, the present matter may also be decided finally .\n8. We have considered the submissions advanced.\n9. In para-4 of the affidavit it is deposed that the petitioner had under gone surgery and was unable to look\nafter his business. In para-7 of the affidavit it is submitted that the order of cancellation of registration was not\ncommunicated to the petitioner physically and on account of the petitioner's health condition, the petitioner\ncould also not be aware of the impugned order .\n10. In Ex.P3 annexed FORM GST APL-01 para-17 also it is mentioned that 'reasons for delay - Health is not\nwell... took bed rest'.\n11. The cause as shown in the af fidavit is suf ficient.\n12. Though the impugned order in view of Section 107 of APGST Act does not suffer from any illegality , as\nthe appellate authority cannot condone  the delay beyond statutory condonable period but considering that\nthere was sufficient cause for not prefer ring appeal in time, the interest of justice requires condonation of the\ndelay . The appeal is a valuable statutory right. In exercise of writ jurisdictio n to do complete justice and\nprovide opportunity of hearing on merits of the appeal, we condone the delay by imposing costs of Rs.\n20,000/-.

The grievance of the petitioner as ventilated by learned counsel is that as against the cancellation of GST\nRegistration number by the 4th respond ent, the petitioner has filed appeal before the 1st respondent digitally\nthrough official website, but as per his information since the appellate authority has not been mapped i.e.,\nconstituted, the digital mode of filing of appeal has not been so far accepted and numbered. Learned counsel\nwould further submit that the petitioner filed appeal manually and the same is pending for consideration.\nLearned counsel would submit that since the date of show-cause notice i.e., 20.03.20 23, the petitioner's\nregistration was suspended and later it was cancelled, as such, the petitioner is not able to transact through his\nregistration number . We perused the copy of provisional acknowledgment for submission of form of appeal\nfiled along with the material papers which bears the stamp of Appellate Additional Commissioner(ST),\nTirupati, dated 26.04.2023, which prim a facie manifests that the petitioner indeed filed appeal before the\naforesaid authority . Now , the submission of learned counsel for petitioner is that the petitioner proposes toPOONAMsubmit supporting documents like invoices and other relevant material and as his registration was cancelled,\nhe cannot upload digitally those documents.\n3. Learned Government Pleader would submit that since the petitioner has already filed appeal and the same is\npending consideration, the petitioner can submit his case on merits before the Appellate Authority . Learned\nGovernment Pleader  would affirm that the 1st respondent was constituted as Appellate Authority and the said\nauthority would take up the appeal if already filed as submitted by the petitioner .\n4. Considering the above respective submissions and in the interest of justice, we deem it apposite to direct\nthe 1st respondent to consider the appeal said to have been filed by the petitioner and register the same if it is\notherwise in order and process the same for hearing within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis order . Having regard to the fact that petitioner's registration was cancelled, we give liberty to the\npetitioner to submit all the relevant documents before the 1st respondent manually , in which case, the said\nauthority shall admit them and after affording an opportunity of hearing to both parties, pass an appropriate\norder in accordance with the governing law and rules expeditiously .\n5.

Petitioner further seeks a direction to the respondents to grant refund of Rs.\n88,89,1 13.00 along with applicable interest being the excess payment of tax by the petitioner for the aforesaid\nperiod.\n3. Petitioner is registe red under the Good s and Services Tax (GST) and is engage d in the business of textiles\nand sale of readymade garments. Petitioner has been filing GSTR-3B return s regularly , including for the\nperiod from July , 2017 to March, 2018.SB4. For the aforesaid period, petitioner filed refund application dated 14-1-2022 before respondent No. 1\nclaiming refund of Rs. 88,89,1 13.00, the breakup of which is as under -\n(i) Integrated Goods and Services T ax (IGST) - Rs. 76,08,563.00;\n(ii) Central Goods and Services T ax (CGST) - Rs. 6,40,275.00; and\n(iii) State Goods and Services T ax (SGST) - Rs. 6,40,275.00\n5. The refund application was made on the ground that there was excess payment of GST by the petitioner for\nthe aforesaid period.\n6. A show cause notice dated 9-3-2022 was issued to the petitioner by respondent No. 1 stating that the refund\napplication was barred by limitation as the petitioner ought to have claimed the refund within two years from\nthe relevant date i.e., from  the date of excess payment made in terms of section 54 of the Central Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017/Telangana Good s and Services Tax Act, 2017. Therefore, respondent No. 1 proposed\nto reject the claim of refund. Petitioner was called upon to file objection, if any , with documentary evidence.\n7. Petitioner submitted a detailed objection before respondent No. 1 on 10-3-2022 wherein petitioner\nspecifically pointed out that the refund application was within time and could not be construed to be beyond\nlimitation.\n8. Ther eafter , respondent No. 1 passed the impugned order dated 16-3-2022 rejecting the claim of refund\nmade by the petitioner . Insofar reasons for the refund amount being inadmissible, it was mentioned in the\nimpugned order as \"delay in refund application\".\n9.

The learned counsel for the petitione r took us through the Notification, dated 28-6-2017, issued vide\nNotification No. 11/2017, Notification No. 31/2017, dated 13-10-2017 and Notification No. 6/21, dated 30-9-\n2021, to show that a reading of the same would clearly establish that for the work done by the petitioner , it has\nto pay tax @ 5% tax and imposition of 18% by the assessing authority is bad in law .\n5. He would submit that since the product manufactured by the petitioner i.e., alcohol/beverages/liquor falls\nunder Chapter 22 of the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, the responde nts can only demand payment\nof tax at 5% and not at 18%. In other words, the argument of the learned couns el for the petitioner appears to\nbe that since liquor also falls within the category of \"Food and food products\" under Chapter 22, as it was\nsought to be inserted at serial No. 26 after clause 'e', the rate of tax payable is only 5%.\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner further contends that having regard to Notification No. 6/2021, dated 30-\n9-2021, which came into from 1-10-2021, the services by way of job work can only be taxed at 5% and not at\n18% as no notificat ion is published in the Gazette till 30-9-2021. In other words, Sri Suri Babu, learned\ncounsel, would contend that the said notification, even if acceptable, can only be prospective in operation but\nnot retrospective .\n7. However , Sri Y.N. Vivekananda, learne d Government Pleader for Commercial Tax appearing for the State,\nwould submit that when the issue involves disputed questions of fact, the proper remedy for the petitioner is to\nfile an appeal. Even otherwise, he would contend that there is no necessity for any Gazette Publication in\nrespect of Circulars  issued by G.S.T . Council from time to time. Referring to Notification Nos. 11/2017 and\n6/2021 coupled with Notification No.31/2017, he would contend that the argument of the learned counsel that\nNotification No. 11/2017 is substituted by Notification No. 6/2021 is not correct. On the other hand, he would\ncontend that the issue before the Court is whether all food and food products falling under Chapter 1 of First\nSchedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 includes alcohol. In other words, his argument appears to be thatonly food and food products falling under Chapter 1 to 22 in the First Schedule alone are included and the\nsame would not cover alcohol.\n8. Sri Y.N. Vivekananda, learned Government Pleader , further submits that since the notification is silent as to\nwhether it is prospective or retrospective  in operation, it is an established principle of law that the same would\nbe retrospective  in operation and that the petitioner has to pay 18% tax instead of 5%.\n9. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\"(i) Whether liquor is a food or food product? And\n(ii) Whether imposing tax at 18% for the job work done in relation to manufactu re of liquor for human\nconsumption at 18% is prospective in operation?\"\n10. POINTS:\nThe assessing authority , after analyzing the subject on record, held as under:\u2014\n\"\u2026\u2026.. The objection is examined and found to be not tenable. All the products classifiable under\nChapter 1 to 22 don't attracts 2.5% tax under the Act as per entry no:26( f) of notific ation no:11/2017-CT\n(Rate) dt : 28-6-2017. Only food and food products of these chapters are eligible for this exemption. Now\nit is to be seen whether the alcoholic liquor for human consumption can be considered as food for the\npurpose of levy of tax at lower rate under the said notification. There is no definition of food and food\nproducts under the Act. However , the Supreme Court in the case of Collector of Central Excise  v. Parle\nExports Pvt. Ltd . reported in 1998 (38) ELT 741 (SC) held that non-alcoholic beverages were not eligible\nfor exemption as food products. Everything consumed by human cannot be considered as food or food\nproducts for the purpose of exemption from GST. The context and spirt and reason of law need to be\nexamined to extend exemption. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment has held that \"it\ncannot be contended that expensive items lie Gold-Spot base, Limca base or Thumsup base were\nintended to be given exemption at the cost of public exchequer .\" Similarly it would have never been the\nintention of law to exempt expensive items like \"Alcoholic Liquor\" under the category of food and food\nproducts even through the same is for human consumption. Further the notificat ion no:6 dt: 30-9-2021 is\nclarificatory in nature for the above position, therefore the objection is rejected as not tenable.\"\n11. In order to appreci ate the arguments advanced, it is to be noted that on 28-6-2017, the Government of\nIndia issued Notification No. 11/2017, in exercise of their powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 9,\nsub-section (1) of section 11, sub-section (5) of section 15 and sub-section (1) of section 16 of the C.G.S.T .\nAct, 2017, pursuant to which, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the Council and on being\nsatisfied that it is necessary in the public  interest, sought to notify that the central tax, on intra-state supply of\nservices of description, as specified in Column (3) of the T able given therein, falling under Chapter , Section or\nHeading of scheme of classification of services as specified in Column (2) therein, shall be levied at the rate\nas specifie d in the corresponding entry in Column (4). The word \"food and food products\" or \"alcohol\" i.e.,\nbeverages was not included under the Heading 9988 but however , tax payable for products mentioned therein\nwas shown as \"2.5\" (2.5% + 2.5%). On 13-10-2017, Notification No. 31/2017 came to be issued making\namendments to Notification No. 11/2017 whereby , in item (i), after sub-item (e), all food and food products\nfalling under Chapters 1 to 22 in the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 came to be added. But\nhowever , the tax to be paid remained unaltered at 5%. Learned counsel refer s to Chapter 22 dealing with\n\"Beverages, spirits and vinegar\" to contend that as liquor forms part of Chapter 22, it was included, treating it\nas food. However , on 30-9-2021, Notification No. 6/2021 came to be issued making further amendments to\nNotification No. 1 1/2017 whereby , as against serial No. 26, in Column (3), -\n(A) after item (ic) and the entries relating thereto in columns (3), (4) and (5), the following entries came\nto be inserted:-\n (3) (4)(5)\n \"(ica) Services by way of job work in relation to manufacture of alcoholic liquor for human\nconsumption9\"\nFrom the above, it is clear that the initial tax imposed @ 5% was enhanced to 18%, in respect of the\nnature of the work done by the petitioner .12. It is also to be noted here that Notificati on No. 6/2021 does not substitute earlier notification issued by the\nGovernment. It only clarifies the earlier notification by incorporating a clause, having regard to the law laid\ndown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n13. It is no doubt true that only food and food products, as reflected in Chapters 1 to 22 in the First Schedule,\nare eligible for payment of less tax. Whether alcoholic liquor for human consumption can be considered as\nfood for the purpose of levying tax at lower rate under the said notification?\n14. It is an admitted fact that there is no definition of \"food and food products\" under the Act but at the same\ntime, whatever consumed by human beings cannot be construed as \"food and food products\" for the purpose\nof exemption under G.S.T .\n15. In Collector of Central Excise  v. Parle Exports (P.) Ltd. 1989 taxmann.com 1087/1988 ELT 741\n(SC)/ [1989] 75 STC 105, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it will never be the intention of legislature to\nexempt expensive items like alcoholic liquor under the category of food and food products though the same is\nfor human consumption. While dealing with the meaning of the word \"food products or food beverages\", the\nHon'ble Supreme Court, in Parle Exports (P.) Ltd. (supra ) case, observed that there is no direct evidence, as\nsuch, as to how in commercial parlance, unlike in ordinary parlance, non-alcoholic beverage bases are treated\nor whether they are treated as food products or food preparations. The purpose of exemption is to encourage\nfood production and also give boost to the production of goods in common  use and need. After all, the\npurpose of exemption is to help produ ction of food and food preparations at cheaper price and also help\nproduction of items which are in common use and need.\n16. Keeping in view the observations made in the judgments referred to above, it is to be seen whether the\npetitioner is entitled to any exemption and whether any exemption can be granted for the past transactions.\n17. The issue as to whether alcoholic liquor is a food was dealt with by the GST Council in its 45th Meeting\nheld on 17-9-2021. As recommended by the Council, it was clarified that food and food products in the said\nentry excludes alcoholic beverages for human consumption. It also states that in common parlance also,\nalcoholic liquor is not considered as a food. As such, services by way of job work in relation to manufacture\nof alcoholic liquor for human consumption are not eligible for GST @ 5% prescribed under the said entry . It\nwould be appropriate to extract the same, which is as under:\u2014\n\"H. Clarification in r elation to GST rate on services\n1. Coaching services to students provided by coaching institutions and NGOs under the central sector\nscheme of 'Scholarships for students with Disabilities' is exempt from GST .\n2. Services by cloud  kitchens/central kitchens are covered under 'restaurant service', and attract 5% GST\n[without ITC].\n3. Ice cream parlor sells already manufactured ice-cream. Such supply of ice cream by parlors would\nattract GST at the rate of 18%.\n4. Overloading char ges at toll plaza are exempt from GST being akin to toll.\n5. The renting of vehicle by State Transport Undertakings and Local Authorities  is covered by expression\n'giving on hire' for the purposes of GST exemption.\n6. The services by way of grant of mineral exploration and mining rights attracted GST rate of 18% w.e.f.\n1-7-2017.\n7. Admission to amusement parks having rides etc. attracts GST rate of 18%. The GST rate of 28%\napplies only to admission to such facilities that have casinos etc.\n8. Alcoho lic liquor for human consumption is not food and food products for the purpose of the entry\nprescribing 5% GST rate on job work services in relation to food and food products.\"\n18. On the other hand, GST Council recommended that such job work would attrac t GST at the rate of 18%. It\nis now urged that the recommendations of the GST Council are not binding and they are only directions. Even\nassuming it to be so, a plain reading of the item, which is in dispute, would clearly show that same cannot be\ntreated as an article of food. It cannot be treated as an item of food for many a reasons, more particularly , for\nthe advertisements carried on the item that consumption of the same would be injurious to health, etc.\nTherefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that since alcoholic liquor found in entry 26SBin terms of Notifica tion No. 11/2017, dated 28-6-2017, and thereafter , has to be treated as an article of food\nand as such, it is liable to be taxed at 5% (2.5% C.G.S.T . & 2.5% S.G.S.T .) cannot be accepted. Hence, the\nsame is required to be taxed at 18%.\n19. Even otherwise, Notification No. 6/202 1, dated 30-9-2021, published in the Gazette on 30-9-2021 itself\nincorporates service s by way of job work in relation to manufacture of alcoholic liquor for human\nconsumption as item No. (ica) in Column No. 3 of Serial No. 26 and the rate of tax is mentioned @ 9% (i.e.,\n9%+9%=18%). Since the manufacture by the petitioner relates to alcohol for human consumption by way of\njob work, the petitioner is liable to pay tax at 18%.\n20. The next question that falls for consideration is:-\n\"Whether the petitioner is liable to pay tax at 18% with pr ospective or retrospective  effect?\"\n21. In view of the finding given by us that \"alcoholic liquor for human consumption\" does not constitute food\nor food product falling within Chapters 1 to 22 of First Schedule of Customs T ariff Act, 1975, we hold that the\npetitioner is liable to pay tax at the rate of 18% in terms of Notification No. 6/2021, dated 30-9-2021. Apart\nfrom that, it is also to be noticed that at no point of time, any exemption was specifically granted to \"alcoholic\nliquor for human consumption\". Neither  the notification nor the items mentioned in Chapters 1 to 22 spell out\nclearly that \"alcohol ic liquor for human consumption\" as food or food product. The petitioner , on its own, has\nbeen claiming exemption, which lead to issuance of notification No. 6/2021. Though the same was published\nin Gazette on 30-9-2021, but this being clarificatory in nature, it has to be retrospective  in operation.\n22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in CIT v. Vatika Township (P.) Ltd. [2014] 49 taxmann.com 249/227 Taxman\n121/367 ITR 466/271 CTR 1, while dealing with retrospectivity  of legislation, quoted G.P Singh's Principles\nof Statutory interpretation, which is as under :\n\"If a new Act is 'to explain' an earlier Act, it would be without object unless construed retrospective . An\nexplanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to the\nmeaning of the previous Act. It is well settled that if a statute is curative or merely declaratory of the\nprevious law retrospective  operation is generally intended. The language 'shall be deemed always to have\nmeant' is declaratory , and is in plain terms retrospective . In the absence of clear words indicating that the\namending Act is declaratory , it would not be so construed when the pre-amended provision was clear and\nunambiguous. An amending Act may be purely clarificatory to clear a meaning of a provision of the\nprincipal Act which was already implicit. A clarificatory amendment of this nature will have\nretrospective  effect and, therefore , if the principal Act was existing law which the Constitution came into\nforce, the amending Act also will be part of the existing law .\"\nIn view of law laid down by Hon'b le Supreme Court and as the notification issued herein being of\nclarificatory in nature it is retrospective  in operation.\n23. For all the above said reasons, we see no merit in W rit Petition and same is liable to be dismissed.\n24. Accordingly , this W rit Petition is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The challenge in this writ petition is to the impugned proceedings issued under Rules 22(1) and Sub-Rule\n(2A) of 21 of GST Act, vide reference Number:Z A370623035317K, dated 20.06.2023 in Form GST issued by\nan undisclosed authority seeking show -cause for cancellation of registration of the petitioner's GSTIN\nNo.37AA TCA9148B1ZD w.e.f.20.06.2023. Apart from the merits of the contents of the notice, the prime\ngrievance of the petitioner , as ventilated by his learned counsel is that the show-cause notice was issued on\nvague, obscure and undecipherable ground and thereby , the petitioner is deprived of the opportunity to submit\nhis objection/explan ation. Learned counsel further submitted that the particula rs of the issuing authority areAJAYalso not mentioned, so he is unable to know as to whether it was issued by the Central Authority under CGST\nAct or the State Authority under AP GST Act, 2017. In these circumstances, learned counsel would submit,\nthough the petitioner was not able to fully understand the purport of the show-cause notice, however , he\nsubmitted his explanation on 20.06.2023 i.e., on the same date of receiving the show -cause notice giving all\nthe plausi ble explanations which are at his disposal. Learned counsel would thus submit that since the\nsuspension of the registration causes any amount of hardship, the impugned show-cause notice may be set\naside. Learned counsel would submit that on verification he came to know that the impugned show-cause\nnotice was issued by the Assistant Commissioner (Central Taxes), Chittoor -1 Range, Tirupati Division and\ntherefore, he addressed his explanation to the said authority and impleaded the Superintendent, Central Tax,\nChittoor Range, T irupati Division, as the 1st respondent, for convenience sake.\n3. Sri Suresh Kumar Routhu, learned Senior Standing Counsel for CBIC for the respondents, on oral\ninstructions, would submit that the impugned show-cause notice has not been emanated from the office of\neither the Assistant Deputy Commissioner (Central Taxes), Tirupati Division, or any other Central Authority\nand requested the Court to pass appropr iate orders accordingly . Learned Government Pleader for Commercial\nTaxes represented the matter thereafter and that is how , the matter is heard.\n4. As rightly submitted by the learned counsel for petitioner , the reason for issuing show-cause notice is very\ncryptic and undiscernible with regard to the default if any committed by the petitioner as the reason shown is\nas follows:\n\"Non compliance of any specified provisions in the GST Act or the Rules made thereunder as may be\nprescribed.\"\n5. The reason shown above requires no further emphasis as it is vague and delphic and therefore, show-cause\nnotice gives no scope for the petitioner to give an affective reply . Still, the petitioner submitted his\nexplanation/objections on 20.06.2023 giving certain details therein, which in our view need not be discussed\nat length as the show-cause notice itself suffers the vice of obscurity . That apart, the particulars such as\ndesignation and office of the issuing authority are also not mentioned in the show-cause notice. In our\nconsidered view , these defects themselves are sufficient to strike down the notice at the threshold. We are\nconstrained to hold that this is not the first occasion where these type of show-cause notices are being issued\nby the concerned authorities without clearly mentioning the reason for issuing such notice and without\nmentioning the particulars of issuing authority . We hope and trust that the concerned authorities will be\ndiligent here after in issuing show-cause notices, as such notices contain drastic orders of suspension of the\nregistration of the concerned assessees causing much hardship to them.\n6. Accordingly , this writ petition is allowed and the impugned show-cause notice under Rules 22(1) and Sub-\nRule (2A) of 21 vide refer ence Number:ZA370623035317K, dated 20.06.2023, is set aside and consequently ,\nthe registration of the petitioner is restored with immediate effect. However , this order will not preclude the\nconcerned authority to issue a fresh show-cause notice embedding all neces sary and relevant particulars\ntherein so as to enable the petitioner to submit his explanation. No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Challenging the said order , the instant writ petition is\nfiled.\n2. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax-II.\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that since the GST Appellate Tribunal has not been\nconstituted, the writ petition may be entertained. Additionally , while admitting that there is a delay of 56 days\nbeyond the condonable period, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner was bedridden\nduring the relevant period i.e., from 5-8-2023 to 30-9-2023, as he fell in the bathroom and sustained back\ninjury . The said delay of 56 days was not wanton but because of his ill-health and this factor was not\nconsidered by the 1st respondent/1st Appellate Authority on the ground that the said authority cannot condone\nthe delay beyond the condonable period. He thus requested to consider the said fact and condone the delay\nand remit the matter  back to the 1st respondent to admit the appeal and hear the petitioner . Learned counsel\nrelied upon the decisions of the High Court of Telangana reported in Narayanpet Municipality  v.\nSuperintendent of Central T ax 2023  (74) G.S.T .L.296 (Telangana) and of this Court in W.P.Nos.17349 of 2023\n& 42201 of 2022 to buttress his ar guments.\n4. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax-II. opposed the writ petition stating that, because there\nwas a delay of 56 days beyond the condonable period, 1st respondent was right  in rejecting the appeal and as\nsuch the present writ petition is not sustainable.\n5. We have considered the above respective submissions and perused the material available on record.\n6. As submitted by the petitioner , the 1st respondent has rejected the appeal on the sole ground that the appeal\nwas filed with a delay of 56 days which was beyond the condonable period. Except that no other merits in the\ncase of the petition er were discussed. Be that it may, admittedly the GST appellate tribunal has not been\nconstituted in terms of Sec.1 12 of APGST Act 2017 to carry out the matter to the said Tribunal. Therefore,\nthis writ petition can be entertained by this Court.\n7. In Narayanpet Municipality  v. Superintendent of Central Tax [2013] 150 taxmann.com 303/98 GST\n289/2023 (74) G.S.T .L.296 (Telangana)  when GST Registra tion was cancelled and the same was challenged,\nthe appeal was dism issed by the appellate authority on the sole ground that the appeal was filed beyond the\ncondonable period. In that context, the Division Bench of High Court of T elangana has observed thus:\n\"(8) we further find that the issue pertains to cancellation of GST registration of the petitioner . In the\nfacts and circumstan ces of the case, it would be just and proper if the entire matter is remanded back to\nrespondent No. 1 to reconsider the case of the petitioner and thereafter to pass appropriate order in\naccordance with law .\n(9) In the light of the above and without expressing any opinion on merit, we remand the matter back to\nthe file of the respondent No. 1 to consider the grievance expressed by the petitioner against cancellation\nof GST registration  and thereafter pass an appropriate order in accordance with law. Needless to say,\nwhen the responden t No. 1 hears the matter on remand, petitioner would be at liberty to submit the\nreturns as per the statute.\n(10) W rit petition is accordingly disposed of.\"\n8. The abov e decision applies to the case of the petitioner as in the instant case also the sole ground on which\nthe appeal  was rejected was because the same was filed beyond the condonable period. Learned Government\nPleader no doubt argued that the facts in the case are slightly different because the Division Bench of\nTelangana High Court also considered the fact that the GST Registration of the petitioner therein was\ncancelled suomotu on the ground of non filing of returns and allowed the writ petition and remitted the matter\nback to the concerned appellate authority . However , in the present case the main issue was that the appeal was\nrejected on the point that the same was filed beyond the condonable period. In our view both the cases deal\nwith same  aspect i.e., condoning the delay that was occurred beyond condonable period. In that case the\nimpugned Order challenged in Appeal was the cancellation of Registration. Whereas, in the case on hand, the\nimpugned order under challenge in Appeal is the Assessment Order . Howev er, the principle in the cited\ndecision being the condonation of delay beyond the condonable period, the same can be made applicable toAJAYcase on hand also. Similarly , in Writ Petition Nos.17349 of 2023 and 42201 of 2022 a Division Bench of this\nHigh Court where one of us is a mem ber, has considered similar issue and condoned delay on terms and\nremitted the matter back to the 1st appel late authority . In view of the above judgments, we consider it apposite\nto allow the writ petition, however , on imposing suitable terms.\nAccordingly this writ petition is allowed by condoning the entire delay in filing the appeal before the appellate\nauthority on the condition of the petiti oner depositing costs of Rs. 20,000/- before the appellate authority\nwithin a period of one week from the date of receipt of copy of this Order . On such payment of costs, the\nappellate authority/1 st respondent shall restore the appeal and admit the same and pass necessary orders on\nmerits after hearing both parties. There shall be no order as to costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Heard Sri Dr. M.V.K. Moorthy , learned senior counsel appearing for the petitio ner and learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T ax representing the respondents.\n3. Learned senior coun sel submits that the 2nd respondent issued show cause notice dated 12-6-2023 alleging\nthat the petitioner has committed fraud, willful misstatement or suppression of facts in terms of section 29(2)\n(e) of CGST/SGST Act; alleged that the person issued invoices or bills without supply of goods or services orboth in violation of the rule 21(b) of the Act and also alleged that the petitioner avails ITC in violation of the\nprovisions of section 16 of the Act and also violated the provisions of rules 86B and 21 ( g), without furnishing\ntheir requisite particulars.\n4. Learned senior counsel further subm its that while issuing show cause notice, dated 12-6-2023 GST\nregistration of the petitioner was put under suspension with immediate effect i.e., on 12-6-2023. He further\ncontends that though notice is cryptic, the petitioner in due compliance of the notice submitted his\nreply/explanation on 6-7-2023 furnish ing the required particulars to the extent possible as against the\nallegations contained in the show cause notice. Pursuant thereof, the cancellation order has been passed.\n5. Learned senior counsel also submits that the impugned order of cancellation of Registration came to be\npassed on 3-8-2023  by the 1st respondent, without referring and taking into consideration the explanation\ndated 6-7-2023 offered by the petitioner . Learned counsel would thus submit that by issuing the cryptic show\ncause notice and passing final order without referring to the explanation of the petitioner and without\naffording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner , the 1st respondent commi tted violation of principles of\nnatural  justice. He thus sought to set aside the impugned order .\n6. Learned Government Pleader supporte d the impugned show cause notice dated 12-6-2023 and the final\norder dated 3-8-202 3, stating that both of them contain sufficient particular s and the petitioner has also\nsubmitted his explanation to the show cause notice, and therefore, now it cannot be pleaded that the show\ncause notice is bereft of required particulars.\n7. The points for consideration are,\n(i) Whether the show cause notice is devoid of required particulars, and thereby , it was not possible for\nthe petitioner to furnish/of fer detailed explanation?\n(ii) Whether in the final order of cancellation of Registration dated 3-8-2023, the 1st respondent has not\nreferred and considered the explanation dated 6-7-2023 of fered by the petitioner?\n(iii) If Points 1 and 2 are held in affirmation, whether there occurred violation of principles of natural\njustice?\nPoints (i) to (iii):-\n8. As all these points  are inter connected, they are considered and answered together . We have perused the\nshow cause notice dated 12-6-2023 issued by the 1st respondent. Since the show cause notice is a brief one,\nthe same is reproduced here for the sake of convenience:\n\"Whereas on the basis of information which has come to my notice, it appear s that your registration is\nliable to be cancelled for the following reasons:\n1. Section 29(2)( e)-registration obtained by means of fraud, willful misstatement or\nsuppression of fact.\n2. Rule 21(b) - person  issues invoice or bill withou t supply of goods or services or both in\nviolation of the provisions of the Act, or the rules made thereunder .\n3. Rule 21( e)-person avails ITC in violation of the provisions of section 16 of the Act or the\nrules made thereunder .\n4. Rule 21( g) - person violates the provision of rule 86B\n Your are hereby directed to furnish a reply to the notice within seven working days from\nthe date of service of this notice.\nIf you fail to furnis h a reply within the stipulated date or fail to appear for personal hearing on the\nappointed date and time, the case will be decided  ex parte  on the basis of available records and on merits.\nPlease note that your registration stands suspended with ef fect from 12-6-2023.\"\n9. As can be seen from the show cause notice, so far as the 1st allegation is concerned, the 1st respondent only\nmentioned that the registration was allegedly obtained by means of fraud, willful misstatement or suppression\nof facts. However , there are no other relevant requisite facts mentioned in the said allegation as to the mannerSBhow the petitioner committed fraud or willful misstatement or suppression of the facts relating to his obtaining\nregistration. In the present form of allegation, it will be difficult for anybody including the petitioner to offer\nhis explan ation to the said allegation No. 1. Therefore, as rightly submitted by the learned senior counsel for\nthe petitioner , said allegation is vague and bereft of relevant particulars.\n10. In so far as the second allegation is concerned, it is stated, the 'person' issued invoice or bill without\nsupplying goods or services are both, in violation of the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder .\nHere also the said allegation is not clear enough to communicate whether the \"person' means the petitioner\nherein or his vendor s and particulars of fake invoices and bills. Therefore, this allegation is also as vague as it\ncould be without giving an opportunity to the petitioner to submit his explanation in a proper manner .\n11. The third allegatio n is to the effect that in terms of Rule 21(e), 'person'  avails ITC in violation of\nprovisions of section 16 of the Act. This allegation is also not clear as to what is the nature  of the violation of\nthe provisions, committed by the petitioner under section 16 of CGST/AGST Act.\n12. So also the allegation No. 4 is to the effect that in terms of rule 21(g) the assessee has allegedly violated\nthe provisions of rule 86B is bereft of relevant particulars. Thus as can be seen, the show cause notice is not\nreflecting the necessary particulars to enable the petitioner to of fer his explanation.\n13. We have gone throu gh the explanation dated 6-7-2023, a copy of which filed along with material papers.\nSaid explanation shows that the petition er seems to have offered his remarks to the extent possible, in respect\nof each allegation made in the show cause notice. Then the final order dated 3-8-2023 shows, curiously said\nexplanation was neither referred in the said order nor the merits of the explanation are considered by the 1st\nrespondent.\n14. Thus, on a conspec tus of the facts, we are of the considered view that the 1st respondent, in issuing the\nshow cause notice without necessary details and passing the final order of cancellation of Registration, not\nfollowed the principles of natural  justice, and therefor e, the show cause notice dated 12-6-2023 as well as the\nfinal order  dated 3-8-2023 are liable to be set aside and are accordingly set aside. The respondent authorities\nare directe d to restore the registration of the petitioner , within a period of one week from the date of receipt of\na copy of this order . We must make it clear that this order will not preclude the respondents to issue a fresh\nshow cause notice with necessary particulars and to proceed in accordance with law .\n15. The W rit Petition is disposed of accordingly . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n* In favour of assessee."}

Durga Prasad Rao, J. - In this writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the\npetitioner prays for following relief:\n\"to issue an appropriate writ order or direction more particularly in the nature of mandamus declaring that\nthe impugned Assessment + penalty + interest order passed by 1st respondent in Form GST DRC-07  vide\nDIN:DIN3707022356293 dated 7-2-2023 for the Tax Periods 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 under the\nCGST and SGST Acts imposing tax on Bio Pro-Enhac, Minwa and Minwa Plus which are Animal Feed\nSupplements and Feed Additives from drugs which are exempt falling under HSN Code from 2309\nwithout any discus sion about the various judgments cited before him as arbitrary , unjust without\njurisdiction contrary  to law and illegal and consequently  set aside  the same and pass such other order or\norders as deemed fit and proper in the circumstances of the case and in the interests of justice.\"\n2. The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) The petitioner is a registered tax payer under the GST Act, 2017 engaged in the business of\nmanufacture and sale of Prawn Feed and Health Care Products of Shrimp. Prawn feed with HSN\nCode number 2309 is exempted from tax under the GST laws. Accordingly , the petitioner reported\nthe sales of prawn feed sold by it in its returns and claimed exemption on the same.\n(b) The 1st respondent conducted inspectio n of the business premises of petitioner on 11-11-2022 and\nthereafter issued intimation in Form GST-01A dated 23-11-2022 and after obtaining the reply dated\n6-12-2022 from the petitioner , issued show cause notice dated 9-12-2022 stating therein that the\nproducts \"Bio Pro-Enhac\" and \"Minwa and Minwa plus\" sold by the petitioner fall under HNS code\n2936 and 2931 respe ctively and taxable @ 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST) and proposed to reject the\npetitioner's claim of exemption on the ground that prawn feed fall under HSN 2309 and proposed to\nimpose tax @ 18% in spite of the petitioner filing a detailed objection/reply  vide letter dated 9-1-\n2023 and attending  personal hearing on the same day and submitted additional information by\nemail on 21-1-2023. Subsequently the 1st respondent passed the impugned assessment + interest +\npenalty order  vide  DIN:DIN3707022356293 dated 7-2-2023 whereunder he rejected the petitioner's\nclaim of exemption and imposed tax @ 18% + interest + penalty equal to tax on the sales of the\nprawn feed supplements.\n(c) The petitioner's claim is that Bio pro-en hac is one variety of shrimp feed and it is having the same\nelements that are used in the manufactu re of shrimp feed including calcium, propionate, fish meal,\nwheat bran, corn meal, high-pro soya etc. The bio pro-enhac and shrimp feed dif fer primarily in that\ninstead of being pelletted, the substance that is made into feed will be ferment ed after productionand as a result fermented feed is referred as bio pro-enhac. The 1st respondent while admitting that\nthe proces s of manufacture of bio pro-en hac uses the above elements, however , held that it contains\nboth natural and chemical elements which mainly improve immunity , health of shrimp and\ndigestion and food intake of shrimp and vitamins help to resist the infections.\nWith regard to the Minwa and Minwa plus, the 1st respondent held that in the product description it is\nmentioned \"stabilized alkalinity and control of PH fluctuations in water\", and they are not micro minerals with\nHSN code 2309 but come under HSN code 2931\" i.e., \"other organo-inor ganic compounds\" taxable at 18%. It\nis submitted that Sl.No.102 of notification number 2/2017 CTR dated 28-6-2017 provides exemption from\npayment of GST on\n\"\u00c4quatic Feed including Shrimp Feed and Prawn Feed, Poultry Feed and Cattle Feed, including Grass, Hay\nand Straw , Supplements and Additives, Wheat Bran and De-Oiled Cake other than Rice Bran\"\nThe words  \"supplem ents and additives\" show that the exemption is not restricted only to \"Feed\" but also to\n\"supplements and additives\". In a number of decisions of the Apex Court and different High Courts, this\naspect has been elaborately discussed. However , without considering all these factual and technical aspects in\ncorrect lines, the 1st respondent passed the impugned Assessment Order .\nHence, the writ petition.\n3. The 1st respondent filed counter and opposed the writ petition.\n(a) After follo wing due procedure, the impugned Assessment Order dated 7-2-2023  was passed and as\nthe petitioner has an efficacious alternat ive remedy under the statute which he has not availed, the\nwrit petition is liable to be dismissed.\n(b) The products sold by the petitioner purportedly as prawn feed supply are neither covered under\nHSN code  2309 nor are they exempted  from tax as they do not fall under the category of aquatic\nfeed or feed supplements that are consu med by the shrimps. The products imported from China by\nthe petitioner cannot be exempted for the following reasons.\n(i) Bio pro-enhac contains both natural and chemical elements that assists in the improvement\nof water quality , soil quality , immunity and overall health of the shrimp which falls under\nHSN code 2936 i.e., \"Pro vitamins and vitamins, natural or reproduced by synthesis\n(including natural concentrates), deriva tives thereof used primarily as vitamins  and inter-\nmixtures of the foregoing, whether or not in any solvent - vitamins and their derivatives,\nunmixed\". Given its specific chemical components and end usage, Bio Pro-enhac is only\ncapable of being characterized under HSN code 2936. The petitioner's contention that this\nproduct varies from shrimp feed only by way of being fermented but is nothing  but shrimp\nfeed is untenable, baseless and seeks to ignore its vitamin-based overall nature.\n(ii) Minwa and Minwa plus are used in shrimp farming to maintain balanced water quality\nwhile prom oting shrimp culture and to adjust the PH value in the water . These products are\ndirectly poured into the shrimp pond during the phase when the shrimp under go moulting\nwhich is covered under HSN code 2931 i.e., \"organic-inor ganic compounds\" which are\ntaxable at 18%.\n(c) It is true that as per circular notification No. 2/2017 CTR dated 28-6-2017, the supply of \"Aquatic\nfeed inclu ding shrimp feed and prawn feed, poultry feed and cattle feed, including grass, hay and\nstraw , supplements and additives, wheat bran and de-oiled cake other than rice brawn\" are\nexempted from tax. However , it is pertinent to note the subject matter goods supplied by the\npetitioner are different from the goods enumerated in the above notification. These products are\ncovered under HSN code 2931 \"\u00d6ther  organic and Inorganic compounds\" and HSN code 2936\n\"vitamins and pro-vitamins\"\n(d) The generic definition of animal feed which includes animal feed supplements added to animal feed\ncannot be relied upon as the products supplied by the petitioner are not consumed as if shrimp feed\nbut rather are adde d to the water for the specified purpose of ensuring a functional shrimp\nhabitat/environment. In the impugned order , it is elaborated as to how the petitioner's products\nwhen dissolved directly into the pond water ensure that the PH balance and alkalinity levels of thewater are neutrally maintained, thereby avoiding either acidity or alkalinity . Thus, the goods\nsupplied by the petitioner are neither food supplements nor food additives. They are chemical-based\nvitamins and products that are specifically used in the shrimp ponds for the treatment of water in\nmaintaining the PH balance and the same are not mixed in the shrimp feed. The citations relied\nupon by the petitioners have no applica tion. All these aspects have been clearly considered in the\nimpugned order and hence, the writ petition is not maintainable. The respond ents thus prayed to\ndismiss the writ petition.\n4. Heard arguments of Sri S.Ravi, Senior Counsel representing Sri G.Narendra Chetty , counsel for petitioner ,\nand learned Government Pleader for Commercial T axes representing the respondents.\n5. The bone  of contention in this case is to the taxability of two products i.e., \"Bio pro-enhac\" and \"Minwa\nand Minwa plus\" manufactured by the petitioner under the GST regime. The petitioner is a registered taxpayer\nunder the GST Act, 2017 and it is engaged in manufacture and sale of prawn feed and health care products of\nshrimp. The petition er is allocated to central jurisdiction. The petitioner's case is that his two products  viz.,\n\"Bio pro-e nhac\" and \"Minwa and Minwa plus\" come under HSN code 2309 and exempted from tax under the\nGST Act, 2017 and therefore, the petitioner reported sales of prawn feed in its returns and claimed exemption.\n(a) Learned Senior Counsel Sri S.Ravi would argue that one variety of shrimp feed is called \"Bio pro-\nenhac\" and it is having the same elem ents that are used to manufacture shrimp feed including\ncalcium, propionate,  fish meal, wheat bran, corn meal, high-pro soya etc. of feed raw materials. He\nwould further submit that the \"Bio pro-enhac\" and shrimp feed differ primaril y in that, instead of\nbeing pelletted, the substance that is made into feed will be fermented after production and as a\nresult the fermented feed is referred as \"Bio pro-enhac\", whereas pelletted feed is known as shrimp\nfeed. Learned Senio r Counsel would submit that the petitioner imports the said item from China\nwhich is designated as code No. 23099090, Micro Minerals (used for animal feed grade, not for\nhuman consumption). The domestic market will sell the micro minerals packaged with label of\npetitioner's industry i.e., BMR Industries labels under \"Minwa and Minwa plus\" with aforesaid\nHSN code 23099090 which is exempted from GST .\n(b) Learned counsel would further submit that the HSN code 2309 inter alia covers reading vitamins\nand pro-vitamins which improve digest ion and more generally ensure that the animal makes good\nuse of feeds and safeguard its health. On the other hand, HSN code 2936 covers vitamins and pro-\nvitamins which are medicinal in nature and have much higher concentration of active substance. He\nwould submit that the products manufactured by the petitioner are in the nature of food\nsupplements and additives rather than having any medicinal value. He would  submit that as per\nSl.No.102 of notification No. 2/2017 CTR dated 28-6-2017, exemption is provided from payment\nof GST on:\n \"\u00c4cquatic feed including shrimp feed and prawn feed, poultry feed and cattle feed, including grass,\nhay and straw , supplements and additives, wheat bran and de-oiled cake other than rice bran\"\n(c) Referring to the above notification, he would submit that the products manufactured by the\npetitioner would come under supplements and additives to the shrimp feed and they are exempted\nfrom GST. Learned  counsel placed reliance on Sun Export Corporation  v. Collector of Customs\n1997 taxm ann.com 696/93 ELT 641 (SC)/[MANU/SC/0703/1997 = AIR 1997 SC 2658]  and would\ncontend that since the animal feed supplement was held to be exempted under the Customs Tariff\nAct in said decision,  in similar lines, the shrimp feed supplements and additives  are exempted from\nGST. He argued that in the impugned order , the 1st respondent has not properly appreciated the\nratio in the aforesaid decision and came  to a wrong conclusion to the effect that the two products\nare not exempted under the HSN code 2309 but they fall under HSN code 2936 and 2931\nrespectively and hence, liable for tax at 18% under the GST Act.\n6. Per contra, learned  Government Pleader for Commercial Tax argued that the product \"Bio pro-enhac\" is\nconcerned, it contains compound amino acids, biological metabolites and fermentation flavors, promotes\ndigestion, raises food take and also promote feed conversion of shrimp. It also enhances the shrimp immunity\nand healing process. Therefore, \"Bio pro-enhac\" is a product covered by HSN 2936 pro-vitamins and\nvitamins, natural or reproduced by synthesis (including natural concentrates), derivates thereof used primarily\nas vitamins and inter-mixtures of the foregoing and therefore, attracts tax at 18% and the said product will not\nfall under HSN 2309 but comes under 2936.(a) He further argued that so far as the product Minwa and Minwa plus is concerned, it contains\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, aluminum and strontium. Thes e products stabilize\nalkalinity and controls PH fluctuation in water . He argued that the term \"PH\" is the level of acidity\nor alkalinity in water . This is a factor that affects the health of the shrimp growi ng in the pond. The\nPH scale ranges from '0' to '14'. The numbers below '7' indicate high acidity . Similarly , numbers\nabove '7' indicate high alkalinity , whereas, number '7' indicates a neutral status. The PH of the water\nin a shrimp pond should be maintained between '7' and '8' and if such value is not maintained at the\noptimum level, it will affect the growth and survival of the shrimp. He would submit that to\nmaintain the required PH level, the \"Minwa and Minwa plus\" is used in the shrimp ponds. He\nwould submit that this product has nothing to do with the food value nor it is a supplement or\nadditive of the shrimp feed. Hence, it falls under HSN code 2931 i.e., \"other organo-inor ganic\ncompounds\" taxable at 18% GST. Learn ed Government Pleader would submit that in the impugned\norder the 1st respondent has vividly dealt with the nature of two products and correctly held as to\nhow they fall under HSN code No. 2936 and 2931 respectively , but not under HSN code 2309. He\nwould submit that the 1st respondent also considered the ratio in Sun Export Corporation  (supra ).\nHe thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition. He would further argue that since the petitioner has an\nefficacious alternati ve remedy of appe al, the writ petition is not entertainable and liable to be\ndismissed in limini.\n7. The point for consi deration is whether the two products i.e., \"Bi pro-enhac\" and \"Minwa and Minw a plus\"\nmanufactured by petitioner fall under HSN code 2309 but not under 2936 and 2931 respectively and are\nexempted from tax and whether the impugned order is liable to be  set aside  to that extent?\n8. Point: We have punctiliously scrutini zed the pleadings and arguments addressed by both parties and\nperused the impugn ed order . The petitio ner claims total exemption of his products i.e., \"Bio pro-enhac\" and\n\"Minwa and Minwa plus\" from GST on the ground that they fall within the HSN code 2309 and there was a\nnotification No. 2/2017 and on the other hand, the Department would contend that the two products will fall\nunder HSN code No. 2936 and 2931 respectively and liable to be taxed at 18% as per the GST laws.\nAdmittedly , HSN 2309 inter alia covers vitamins and pro-vitamins which improve digestion and more\ngenerally ensures that the animals make good use of the feeds and safeguard its health. On the other hand,\nHSN code  2936 covers vitamins and pro-vitamins which are medicinal in nature and have much higher\nconcentration of active substance, where as HSN code 2931 covers \"other organo-inor ganic compounds\" under\nGST Act, 2017.\n(a) When the impugned order is perused, so far as the product \"Minwa and Minwa plus\" is concerned,\nin the impugned order it is stated that Minwa and Minwa plus contains calcium, magnesium,\npotassium, phosphorous, aluminum and strontium and this product i.e., Minwa and Minwa plus\nstabilize alkalinity and control PH fluctuations in water . The impugned order contains a vivid\nnarration about PH value in water and requirement of maintenance of its level in a shrimp pond.\nSuch description is mentioned under the heading \"importance of PH value in shrimp farming\". It is\nstated thus:\n \"The pH is the level of acidity or alkalinity in water . This is a factor that affects the health of the\nShrimp growing in the pond. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. Numbers below seven indicate high\nacidity . Similarly , numbers above seven indicate high alkalinity . Similarly , the number seven\nindicates a neutral state.\n pH of the water in a Shrimp Pond should be maintained between seven and eight. If the pH value is\nnot at the optimum level, it will af fect the growth and survival of the shrimp.\n The pH of the pool water naturally decre ases and rises throughout the day and night due to changes\nin the amount of carbon dioxide caused by the process of photosynthesis. In the absence of sunlight,\nsince photosynthesis doesn't occurs, the pH of the water decreases at night. Similarly , the pH of the\nwater rises in the afternoon after photosynthesis for a certain period in daytime. To control\ndifference between minimum and maximum daily pH values by using chemicals and fertilizers.\n The control of pH value in fonds by using applying a soluble calcium, Aluminium, magnesium and\npotassium source to ponds with moderate to high alkalinity .\n Calcium is widely used to increase the pH of water . Calcium functions to minimize the rise in pHthat can occur when photosynthesis rates are high. After plants deplete the water of free carbon\ndioxide, they can use bicarbonate as a carbon source. But when using bicarbo nate, plants release\ncarbonate that hydrolyses and causes pH to increase. Calcium ions react at elevated pH to\nprecipitate carbonat e ions as calcium  carbonate, and this reaction minimi zes the amount of\ncarbonate in the water to hydrolyse and increase pH.\n Aluminium used to reduce of high-level pH value in Shrimp ponds. It is a safe and relatively\ninexpensive chemical. It reacts with water to form a certain acid. The pH value in Shrimp ponds\ncan be reduced by applying 10 g of aluminium per 1000 liters of water . The pH value is likely to\nvery quickly from the use of aluminium. It can be mixed with water and poure d into various parts\nof the pond.\n Magnesium helps maintain calcium and alkalinity levels in a Shrimp. If levels are too low, calcium\nwill combine with alkalinity to create calcium carbonate in the water column. This creates a \"snow\"\nthat can stick to pumps, impellers and heaters instead of being used by Shrimp to build their\nskeletons. Magnesiu m binds to the surface of calcium carbonate crystals. This effectively stops\ncalcium carbonate crystal from growing and precipitating out of the aquarium water .\n Potassium is used to correct ionic imbalance in pond water in shrimp farmin g. After potassium\naddition, shrimp post larvae survived well in the water . Potassium decreases gastro-intestinal pH\nand thereby intensifies release of buffering fluids, containing enzymes, from the hepatopancreas in\nshrimp pond.\n The main usage of calcium, Aluminium , magnesium and potassium in shrimp farming is to control\npH value in Shrimp Pond. The water with low and high pH value can be corrected by adding\nchemicals and fertilizers in Shrimp pond.\"\n(b) In the impugned order, the 1st responden t has stated that the main usage of the product Minswa and\nMinwa plus is to control the PH value of the shrimp pond and it is directly  poured in pond. It\ncontains organic and inorganic compounds such as calcium, aluminum, magnesium and potassium\nwhich are used to control the PH value in water . It is also stated that fertilizer s and chemicals are\nused to stabilize alkalinity and control PH fluctuations in water . The 1st respondent thus came to\nconclusion that the Minwa and Minwa plus falls under schedule III Sl.No.40 and Chapter Heading\n29 with description of goods\n \"All organic chemicals\" and the rate of tax thus applicable is 18% for HSN code 2931 i.e., other\norgano-inor ganic compounds in GST Act, 2017. The 1st respondent observed that though the\npetitioner claimed that the product Minwa and Minwa plus as micro minerals and feed\nsupplements, however , it has not mentioned in its reply about HSN code 2931 and not filed its\nobjections why the product do not fall under HSN code 2931.\n(c) We find the above observation perfectl y correct. As can be seen, the product Minwa and Minwa\nplus is neither a shrimp feed nor a supp lement or additive of the shrimp feed. The products' main\npurpose is not to act either as a shrimp food or a food supplement or additive, but its main purpose\nis to maintain PH level in the shrimp pond. Therefore, as rightly observed in the impugned order ,\nthe said product do not fall within the ambit of HSN code 2309 and notification number 2/2017\nCTR dated 28-6-2017.\n(d) Thus, in our view , the impugned order is correct to this extent. So far as the other product \"Bio pro-\nenhac\" is concerned, according to the petitioner , one variety of shrimp feed is the bio pro-enhac and\nis having same elements that are used in the manufacture of shrimp feed including calcium,\npropionate, fish meal, wheat bran, corn meal, high-pro soya etc. It is also his case that bio pro-\nenhac and shrimp feed differ primarily in that instead of being pelletted, the substance that is made\ninto feed will be fermented after production and as a result, fermented feed is referred as bio pro-\nenhac. Thus, the petitioner claims that bio pro-enhac is a one type of shrimp feed and the process of\nmanufacture is only different and further , while the shrimp feed is in the pellet form, the bio pro-\nenhac is in the fermented form. His further claim is that the bio pro-enhac falls under HSN code\n2309 as it works as supplement to the shrimp feed. His case is that not only shrimp feed but its\nsupplements and additives also come under HSN code 2309 and are exempted from tax. In this\ncontext, in Sun Export Corporation  (supra ), the Hon'ble Apex Court was dealing with the questionas to whether \"the animal feed supplement would fall under the exemption notification dated 1-11-\n1982\". Referring to the judgment of Bombay High Court, wherein it was observed that it cannot be\nsaid that animal feed concentrates are not animal feed and in the same manner products which\nsupplement the animal feed and are generally added to animal feed are also covered by the generic\nterm \"animal feed\", the Hon'ble Apex Court held thus:\n \"13. We are in agreement with the above view expressed by the Bombay High  Court. No doubt it\nwas contended on behalf of the Revenue that the contrary view taken by the Tribunal has been\nchallenged in this Court which was rejected  in limine  at the admission stage. We do not think that\nthat dismissal at the admission stage can be relied upon as a binding precedent. Even assuming that\nthere are two views  possible, it is well settled, that one favourable to the assessee in matters of\ntaxation has to be preferred.\"\nBe that as it may, the grievance of the petitioner is that while dealing with the issue as to whether the product\n\"bio pro-enhac\" is a supplement to the shrimp feed and thus exempted from tax, the 1st respondent has not\ncorrectly dealt with the ratio in the Sun Export Corporation  (supra ). In this context, we have perused the\nimpugned order . The discussion and conclusion on bio pro-enhac are as under:\n\"Biopr o Enhac:\nDiscussion:\nBioproEnhac contains the elements Soya bean meal, wheat bran, corn meal, Bacillus subtills,\nMicrozyme, Saccharfying enzyme, Xyla nase, Cellulase Calcium propionate,Fish Meal and Dextorse. Bio\nPro Enhac contains both natural and chemical elements which mainly improve immunity , health of\nShrimp and digestion and food intake of Shrimp.\nFurther the BioproEnhac is in Powder form and normal Shrimp feed in pellet form. This powder form of\nblopro enhacc is mixed with pelleted feed while giving feed to shrimp. Biopro Enhac having good smell\nand attracts shrimp to intake meal and its helps shrimp to digest normal feed, helps improve immunity of\nShrimp.\nThis product mixed  with vitamins, Pro Vitamins and Enzymes both in natural and chemical forms.\nVitamins and Enzymes helps to resistan ce Infection, improve immunity and gets energy from food and\ndigestion of food.\nThe normal Shrimp feed contains comp onents are wheat flour (35 percent), soybean meal (20 percent)\nand fishmeal (25 percent) (Hunter and Chamberlain, 2006) and perhaps yeast and in pellet form. Normal\nshrimp feed does not contains any comp onents like Bacillus subtills, Microzyme, Saccharfying enzyme,\nXylanase, Cellulase, Calcium propionate and Dextorse.\nConclusion:\nChapter 29 (equally applicable to heading 2936), if it is an item of general use. Vitamins and provitamins\nare normally covered under code heading 2936, but if they're prepared as food supplements in the form of\ntablets, etc. they would not be classifiable under this heading as the way they are presented, they are\nsuitable for a specific use.\nHeading 2309 would cover items like feed supplements for animals that contain vitamins and other\ningredients such as cereals and proteins. These are covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309, or\nantibiotic preparations used in animal feeding for example a dried antibiotic mass on a carrier like cereal\nmiddling. The antibiotic content in these items is usually between 8% and 16%. Thus, HS code 2309\nwould cover only such product, which in the form supplied, are capable of specific use as food\nsupplement for animals and not capable of any general use.\nBioproEnhac is prepared in the form of Powder which is in distinct form when compare to normal pellet\nfeed form. By obser ving chapter 29 Vitamins and provitamins are normally covered under code heading\n2936, but if they're prepared as food supplements in the form of tablets, etc. In Shrimp farming normally\nform of tablets was in these and these form tablets shaped into powder form to use shrimps easily .\nOn Careful examination of BioproEnhac usage is general use not in specific nature. It's uses as dietary\nproduct, helps immunity and food intake of Shrimp. It's containing the elements which used for general\npurpose. Vitamins and provitamins are normally covered under code heading 2936, but if they'reKEV ALprepared in the form of tablets, etc. The tax payer not provided information about the content percentage\nof elements used in Biopro enhac. (V itamins, enzymes, antibiotics and feed percentage in this product).\nTherefore, the product Biopro Enhacc falls under the HSN code 2936 i.e Provitamins And Vitamins,\nNatural or Reproduced by Synthesis with ef fect tax rate @18%.\"\n9. From  the above, it would appear , the 1st respondent rejected the claim of the petitioner on the main ground\nthat the taxpayer has not provided information about the content percentage of the elements used in bio pro-\nenhac (vitamins, enzymes, antibiotic and feed percentage). Accordingly , the 1st respondent held the product\nbio pro-enhac falls under HSN code 2936. It must be noted that though the impugned order shows that the\npetitioner placed reliance on the decision in Sun Export Corporation  (supra ) and some other decisions to the\neffect that the supplements and additives of shrimp feed will also fall under the category of shrimp feed, the\nsame was not discussed and analyzed by 1st respondent before recording his conclusion. Therefore, in our\nconsidered view , the impugned order is liable to be set aside  to that extent and the matter requires remand for\nfresh consideration.\n10. Accordingly , this writ petition is partly allowed and the impugned order dated 7-2-2023 is set aside to the\nextent of the 1st respondent's finding on the product \"bio pro-enhac\" and the matter is remanded to 1st\nrespondent to afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner regarding the nature of the product \"bio pro-\nenhac\" and its taxab ility and pass an appropriate order afresh on merits in accor dance with the governing law\nand rules expeditiously . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending if any , shall stand closed.\n*Matter remanded."}

The tender evaluation process was to be done in two stages, i.e., technical bid\nand financial bid. Instruction No. 4 of 'Instructions to bidder' in the tender document required the bidders\nto submit copy of the certificate of registration of GST , EPF , ESI with the appropriate authority valid as on\nthe date of submission of tender documents.\n\u25a0 However , the petitioner did not submit certificate of registration under the GST Act. In this regard,\nassessee took a view that it was an entity involved in the business of Healthcare Services, which wereexempted from payment of Goods and Services Tax by Notification No. 9/2017-Integrated Tax (Rate),\ndated 28-6-2017 and as such the petitioner was exempted from registering it under the GST Act and the\nrequirement of producing GST registration certificate would not apply to petitioner .\n\u25a0 The 2nd respondent rejected the technic al bid of the petitioner and cleared the technical bids of the 3rd\nand 4th respondents.\n\u25a0 On writ petition:\nHELD\n \n\u25a0 It is true that the writ petitions filed against the State or its instrumentalities  in relation to contractual\nmatters are maintain able. However , that general proposition has certain limitati ons. The Court exercising\njurisdiction under article 226 would have to consider the factors, on a case to case basis, before exercising\nits discretion to hear a writ Petition, relating to contractual disputes, under article 226 of the Constitution\nof India.[Para 21]\n\u25a0 Applying the above principles to the present case, the petitioner has not been able to make out any case of\ndiscrimination or bias against the respondents. The only ground that could be raised by the petitioner is\nthat of an arbitrary action of the 2nd respondent, in rejecting the bid of the petitioner and allowing the\nrespondents to participate in the financial bids. It would now be necessary to see whether the said\nallegations hold.[Para 22]\n\u25a0 The first allegation  of arbitrariness is the disqualification of the petitioner . Instruction No. 4 of\n'Instructions to bidder' in the tender document required the bidders to submit copy of the certificate of\nregistration of GST, EPF, ESI with the appropriate authority valid as on the date of submission of tender\ndocuments. It is the admitted case of all sides that the petitioner did not submit certificate of registration\nunder the GST Act. The defence of the petitioner is that the Central Government had issued a notification\nexempting various services, including the primary activity of the petitioner from payment of tax under the\nGST Act. The petiti oner's case is that in view of such an exemption from paym ent of tax, the petitioner\nneed not register under the GST Act and as such does not have to possess a registration certificate under\nthe GST Act to participate in the tenders called by the 2nd respondent.[Para 23]\n\u25a0 Section 23 of the Andhra Pradesh GST Act enumerates the persons who are not liable to register\nthemselves under the said Act.[Para 24]\n\u25a0 This would mean that a person is exempted from the requirement of registration if he is engaged in\nsupplying only those goods and servic es which are exempt from registration and does not supply any\nother goods or servi ces. If such a person deals in any other goods or services, he will not be eligible for\nsuch exemption.[Para 25]\n\u25a0 The 2nd respondent submits that the successful tenderer would be required, as per section IV of the\nTender Documents, to supply medicine sand other goods, which are not exempted under the GST Act, in\nthe process of maintaining SNCUs, and for that reason the 2nd respondent had required all bidders to\nsubmit GST registration certificates. It is clear that in such a situation, the petitioner would have to supply\ndrugs and goods which are not exempt from levy of GST and the petitioner would require to be registered,\nunder the GST Act. In the absence of such a registration certificate, the action  of the 2nd respondent in\nrejecting the technical bid of the petitioner cannot be termed to be arbitrary .[Para 26]\n\u25a0 The second allegation of arbitrariness against the 2nd respondent is the refusal to reject the technical bid\nof the 3rd respondent. The contention of the petitioner is that the 3rd responden t was one of the members\nof a consortium, which was participating in the tender and could not have subm itted the bid as it was not\nthe lead member in the said consortium . This contention is disputed by both respondent Nos.2 and 3.It is\nthe specific stand of both these respondents that there is no stipulation in the tender document that only\nthe lead member of the consortium who filed the bid documents, and that the other members of the\nconsortium cannot file the bid documents.[Para 27]\n\u25a0 The petitioner would seek to point out certain provisions where details of the lead member are required\nand where the lead member has to give certain assurances etc. However , this requirement cannot be taken\nto mean that the bid document has to be filed only by the lead member . All such information and\nassurances can always be obtained by any other member and file before the tender authority . As such itcannot be said that the 3rd respondent is disqualified on that count and the actio n of the 2nd respondent in\nallowing the 3rd respondent in participating in the financial bid cannot be termed arbitrary .[Para 28]\n\u25a0 The 3rd allegation of arbitrariness against the 2nd respondent is that the 2nd respondent allowed the 4th\nrespondent to participate in the financial bid even though the 4th respondent did not have the necessary\nexperience to qualify in the technical bid. Criteria No. 2in the eligibility criteria set out under section-V of\nthe tender document requires the bidder to have a minimum of three years experience in carrying out\noperation and maintenance of SNCUs in private or public sector . The said experience being demonstrated\nby users certificate regarding satisfactor y completion of assignments. The 4th respondent had submitted a\ncertificate from the NRI Academy of Sciences stating that NRI Academy of Sciences through the 4th\nrespondent had provided such services to CHC Seethampeta in ITDA area of Seethampeta, A.P, from\nMarch, 2018 to 13-8-2020 and the certificate from the medical officer of the area hospital Seethampeta\nthat such services were being given at CHC Seethampeta in ITDA area of Seethampeta from 14-8-2020\ntill 29-7-2021. This would show that the 4th respondent has been giving services  for more than three years\nrequired under the said eligibility criteria.[Para 29]\n\u25a0 The contention of the petitioner that such services were not in accordance with the contract between NRI\nAcademy of Science sand the State of A.P., has not been demonstrated by the petitioner . Except a\nstatement that it is not in accordance with the contract between the parties, the petitioner has not placed\nany material before this Court to take such a view . Further , the requirement under the eligibility criteria is\nto ascertain whether such a bidder woul d have the experience and capacity to execute the contract if it is\nawarded to such a bidder . The certificates produced by the 4th Respondent do attest to the experience\nclaimed by the 4th respondent. In the circumstances, the contention of the petiti oner that the action of the\n2nd respondent in this regard is arbitrary must fail.[Para 30]\n\u25a0 The W rit is dismissed.[Para 31]\nCASES REFERRED T O\n \nMichigan Rubber (India) Ltd. v.

Reddy Kovvuri  for the Petitioner . Venkat Reddy Chittem , K. Rathanga Pani Reddy  and P.\nGangaiah Naidu , Sr. Counsel for the Respondent.\nORDER\n \n1. The 2nd responden t had issued a tender notice through Tender Enquiry No. 11.1B/APMSIDC/2021-22,\ndated 15-7-2021 requesting for provision of Sick New Born Care Units (SNCUs) at CHCs, AH, MCHs and\nDHs in Andhra Pradesh. The petitioner had submitted its tender document on 31-7-2021 after complying with\nall the required form alities. The tender evaluation process was to be done in two stages, i.e., techn ical bid and\nfinancial bid. The procedure adopted by the 2nd respondent was that after preliminary evaluation of the\ntechnical bid, the bidders would be informed of their deficiencies which could be rectified by them. In the\ncase of the petitioner , the 2nd respondent had pointed out certain deficiencies, which were rectified by the\npetitioner . However , one of the deficie ncies pointed out by the 2nd respondent was the non-submission of\nGST registration certificate. The petitioner took the stand that it was an entity involved in the business of\nHealthcare Services , which were exem pted from payment of Goods and Services Tax by Notification No.\n9/2017-Integrated Tax (Rate), dated 28-6-2017 and as such the petitioner was exempted from registering it\nunder the GST Act and the requirement of producing GST registration certificate would not apply to the\npetitioner .\n2. The 2nd respondent  rejected the technical bid of the Petitioner and cleared the technical bids of the 3rd and\n4th respondents. Aggrieved by the said rejection of its bid and the acceptance of the technical bid of the 3rd\nand 4th Respondents, the Petitioner has filed the present writ petition.\n3. The contentions of the Petitioner , in this regard, are as follows:A. The bid of the petitioner could not have been rejected on the ground of non-furnishing of GST\nregistration certificate as there was no requirement for the Petitioner to register itself under the GST\nAct and consequently the 3nd respondent could not have insisted for production of such a\nregistration certificate.\nB. The 3rd respondent is part of a consort ium, which had bid for the tender . The lead partner of this\nconsortium is Sri Ramachandra Child ren and Dental Hospital. As per the tender documents,\nwherever consortium  is submitting a tender document, the said tender document can be submitted\nonly by the lead bidder who should authenticate the bids with its digital signature. However , it was\nthe 3rd respondent, who submitted the bid and not Sri Ramachandra Children and Dental Hospital,\nwhich is the lead member of the consortium. In such a situation the bid submitted by the 3rd\nrespondent could not have been taken into account at all.\nC. The 4th respondent did not have minim um three years of experience in carrying out of operation\nand maintenance of operations of SNCU in private and public sectors and as such was not eligible\nto be considered in the technical bid. Further , the 4th respondent while giving its experience details\nhad uploaded the certificate given by NRI Academy of Sciences, which states that the 4th\nrespondent had carried out operations  and maintenance of SNCUs through  NRI Academy of\nSciences in execution of a contract entered by NRI Academy of Sciences with the Government of\nA.P. The petitioner contends that such an experience cannot be taken into account as the contract\nbetween M/s. NRI Academy of Scien ces and the Government of A.P. does not provide for\nsubcontracting or subletting of the contract and as such any such subcontract would be illegal and\ncannot be taken into account.\n4. Respondent Nos.2 and 4 have filed counter affidavits in the matter disputing the contentions raised by the\npetitioners. Sri Rathangapani Reddy , learned counsel appearing for the 3rd respondent made his submissions\non the basis of the documents before the Court.\n5. The 2nd respondent took the stand that the production of GST registration certificate is a mandatory\nrequirement for being qualified in the technical bid and in view of the non-furnis hing of such GST registration\ncertificate, the petitioner had been disqualified. As far as the submission of the bid document by the 3rd\nrespondent is concerned, the 2nd respondent contended that there is no requirement in the tender conditions\nthat only the lead member of the consortium has to submit the bid and as such the submission of the bid by the\n3rd respondent is not defective. The 2nd respondent submitted that the 4th respondent had produced\ncertificates issued by NRI Academy of Sciences for complying with the minim um eligibility criteria of three\nyears experience in operations and main tenance of SNCUs and its bid was also qualified at the technical bid\nstage. Finally , the 2nd respondent relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nMichigan Rubber (India) Ltd.  v. State of Karnataka  [2012] 8 SCC 216 to contend that the writ petition itself is\nnot maintainable. It is also stated in the counter affidavit of the 2nd respondent that the financial bids have\nalso been processed and the consortium of the 3rd Respondent has been declared as L1.\n6. The 4th respondent in its counter affidavit had essentially taken the same stand as that of the 2nd\nrespondent to contend that the certificate produced by the 4th respondent would be sufficient for the 4th\nrespondent to be qualified to participate in the tender process.\n7. Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri, learned couns el for the petitioner , would submit that once the primary activity of\nthe petitioner had been exempted from the purview of GST Act, the 2nd respond ent ought not to have insisted\nupon a GST registration certificate as the same is not necessary as far as the petitioner is concerned. He\nfurther submits that the 2nd respondent  ought not to have qualified the 3rd and 4th respondents as both of\nthem would have to fail at the technical bid stage itself as the lead manager of the consortium in which the 3rd\nrespondent was a member , had not submitted the bid, which is a mandatory requirement under the bid\ndocument. He would also assail the action of the respondents in qualifying the 4th respondent on the ground\nthat the 4th respondent does not have technical experience and the certificates produced by the 4th respondent\nwould not have been accepted as appropriate certificates of experience.\n8. Sri Chittem Venkat Reddy , learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, while reiterating the contention of the\n2nd respondent that the writ petition itself is not maintainable, would also draw the attention of this Court to\nthe scope of work set out in section IV of the Tender Documents and more specifically , the stipulation No. 2\nin the scope of work which would require the service provider to provide all the drugs, medicines, samples\nand other material required for the SNCUs. He would submit that firstly , the exemption granted to the primary\nactivity of the petitioner under the GST Act does not ipso facto exempt the petitioner from requiringregistration under the GST Act. He would further submit that even assuming that registration under GST Act\nis not required for the primary activity of the petitioner , the requirement to supply medicines and other\nsamples while maintaining the SNCUs  would require GST registration on the part of the petitioner . He\nsubmits that in view of this requirement, the petitioner cannot contend that non-production of GST\nregistration certificate by the petitioner cannot be treated as a breach of the mandatory requirements under the\ntender document.\n9. Sri P.Gangaiah Naidu, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 4th respondent would submit that the given\nqualification requires the bidder to have an experience of three years in maintenance of SNCUs either in the\nprivate sector or in the public sector . He submits that in view of the certificates issued by the NRI Academy of\nSciences declaring that the 4th respondent had maintained necessary SNCUs for a period of three years would\nsuffice to meet the condition of minimum experience either under the public sector or under the private sector .\n10. Sri Rath angapani Reddy , learned counsel appearing for the 3rd responde nt would submit that the\nrequirement of production of GST registration certificate is a mandatory requirement under the tender\ndocument. The petitioner having chosen not to challenge the said condition, cannot seek an exemption from\nproduction of such a GST registration  nor claim that the aid condition can be waived in favour of the\npetitioner . He would rely upon the judgm ents of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in India Ramana Dayaram Shetty\nv. International Airport Authority of India  [1979] 3 SCC 489 and a judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of\nDelhi in Quippo Oil & Gas Infrastructur e Ltd. v. Oil Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. [WP (C) No. 2604 of\n2017, dated 8-5-2017] (paragraph 20).\n11. Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri, replying to the above contentions would submit that the Writ petitioner is not\nchallenging the condition requiring the bidders to submit GST registration certificates. On the contrary , it is\nthe case of the petitioner that the said stipulation should be understood to mean that a certificate of registration\nwould not be necessary for bidders who are exempt from such registration.\nConsideration of the Court:\n12. Before going into the merits of the case, the two preliminary issues of maintai nability of the writ petition\nand the scope of judicial review in contractual matters would have to be dealt with.\n13. Sri Ratha ngapani Reddy , learned counsel appearing for the 3rd respondent, contends that the petitioner , by\ninsisting that no GST registration certificate has to be produced by him, is essentially challenging the\ncondition in the tender requiring production of such a certificate. He further submits that once the petitioner\nknowing fully well the requirements of the tender document, has submitted itself to the tender process without\nany demur , the said petitioner cannot turn around and challenge the said requirement. Further , in the absence\nof such a challenge to such a stipulation, the petitioner would not be entitled to dispute the said requirement.\nAs the petitioner , in the present case, has submitted itself to the tender process and has chosen to approach this\nCourt without challenging the said stipulation, the petitioner cannot maintain the present writ petition.\n14. Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is not challenging\nthe stipulation that a GST registration certificate should be filed as part of the tender document. It is his\ncontention that the said condition does not take into account the cases of persons who are exempt from\nobtaining such registration and that the 2nd respondent should have taken that fact into account and permitted\nthe petitioner to participate in the financial bid also.\n15. In view of the abov e submission of Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri, learned counsel for the petitioner , that the\nquestion that would arise is whether the petitioner is exempt from registration under the GST Act itself, the\ncontention raised by Sri Rathangapani Reddy would not arise at all. If it is found that the petitioner is not\nrequired to register itself under the GST Act, the contention of Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri would have to be\naccepted. In the event it is found that the petitioner cannot claim such an exemption, it would have to be held\nthat the decision of the 2nd respondent in rejecting the technical bid of the petitioner is correct.\n16. The scope of judicial review of contractual matters or disputes has been a matter of evolving\njurisprudence. However , the law in this regard is fairly settled. A few of the leading judgments, which have\nset the guidelines on such review are:\n17. In Tata Cellular  v. Union of India  [1994] 6 SCC 65, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at page 687, held as\nunder:\n\"94. The principles deducible from the above are:(1) The modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative action.\n(2) The court does not sit as a court of appe al but merely reviews the manner in which the decision was\nmade.\n(3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative decision. If a review of the\nadministrative decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision, without the necessary\nexpertise which itself may be fallible.\n(4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to\ntender is in the realm  of contract. Norma lly speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the\ncontract is reached by process of negotiations through several tiers. More often than not, such\ndecisions are made qualitatively by experts.\n(5) The Government must have freedom of contract. In other words, a fair play in the joints is a\nnecessary concomita nt for an administra tive body functioning in an administrat ive sphere or quasi-\nadministrative sphere. However , the decision must not only be tested by the application of\nWednesbury princip le of reasonableness (including its other facts pointed out above) but must be\nfree from arbitrariness not af fected by bias or actuated by  mala fide s.\n(6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy  administrative burden on the adminis tration and lead to\nincreased and unbudgeted expenditure.\"\n18. In Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd.'s  case (supra ), the Hon'ble Supre me Court at paragraph No. 23 held as\nunder:\n\"23. From the above decisions, the following principles emer ge:\n(a) The basic requirem ent of Article 14 is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence\nand substance is the heartbeat of fair play. These actions are amenable to the judicial review only to the\nextent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason and not whimsically for any ulterior\npurpose. If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be legitimate to take into\nconsideration the national priorities;\n(b) Fixation of a value of the tender is entirely within the purview of the executive and the courts hardly\nhave any role to play in this process except for striking down such action of the executive as is proved to\nbe arbitrary or unreasonable. If the Government acts in conformity with certain healthy standards and\nnorms such as awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in those circumstances, the interference by\ncourts is very limited;\n(c) In the matter of formulating conditions of a tender document and awarding a contract, greater latitude\nis required to be conceded to the State authorities unless the action of the tende ring authority is found to\nbe malicious and a misuse of its statutory powers, interference by courts is not warranted;\n(d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders have to be laid down to ensure that the contractor\nhas the capacity and the resources to successfully execute the work; and\n(e) If the State or its instrumentalities act reasonably , fairly and in public interest in awarding contract,\nhere again , interference by court is very restrictive since no person can claim a fundamental right to carry\non business with the Government.\"\n19. The Hon'ble Supr eme Court in Joshi Technologies International Inc. v. Union of India [2015] 57\ntaxmann.com 290/232 T axman 201/374 ITR 322 , at paragraphs 69 & 70, held as under:\n\"69. The position thus summarised in the aforesaid principles has to be understood in the context of\ndiscussion that preceded which we have  pointed out above. As per this, no doubt, there is no absolute bar\nto the maintainability of the writ petition even in contractual matters or where there are disputed\nquestions of fact or even when monetary claim is raised. At the same time, discretion lies with the High\nCourt which under certain circumstan ces, it can refuse to exercise. It also follows that under the\nfollowing circumstances, \"normally\", the Court would not exercise such a discretion:\n69.1 The Court may not examine the issue unless the action has some public law character attached to it.69.2 Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute is provided in the contract, the High Court\nwould refuse to exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution and relegate the party to the\nsaid mode of settlement, particularly when settlement of disputes is to be resorted to through the means\nof arbitration.\n69.3 If there are very serious disputed questions of fact which are of comple x nature and require oral\nevidence for their determination.\n69.4 Money claims per se particular ly arising out of contractual  obligations are normally not to be\nentertained except in exceptional circumstances.\n70. Furthe r, the legal position which emerges from various judgments of this Court dealing with different\nsituations/aspects relating to contracts entered into by the State/public authority  with private parties, can\nbe summarised as under:\n70.1 At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts purely in its executi ve capacity and is bound\nby the obligations of fairness.\n70.2 State  in its executive capacity , even in the contractual field, is under obligation to act fairly and\ncannot practise some discriminations.\n70.3 Even in cases where question is of choice or consideration of competing claims before entering into\nthe field of contract,  facts have to be investigated and found before the question  of a violation of Article\n14 of the Constitution could arise. If those facts are disputed and require assessment of evidence the\ncorrectness of which can only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidenc e, involving examination\nand cross-examination of witnesses, the case could not be conveniently or satisfactorily decided in\nproceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. In such cases the Court can direct the aggrieved party\nto resort to alternate remedy of civil suit, etc.\n70.4 Writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution was not intended to\nfacilitate avoidance of obligation voluntarily incurred.\n70.5 Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid contractual obligation. Occurrence of commercial\ndifficulty , inconven ience or hardship in performance of the conditions agreed to in the contract can\nprovide no justification in not complying with the terms of contract which the parties had accepted with\nopen eyes. It cannot ever be that a licensee can work out the licence if he finds it profitable to do so: and\nhe can challenge the conditions under which he agreed to take the licence, if he finds it commercially\ninexpedient to conduct his business.\n70.6 Ordinarily , where a breach of contract is complained of, the party complaining of such breach may\nsue for specific performance of the contract, if contract is capable of being  specifically performed.\nOtherwise, the party may sue for damages.\n70.7 Writ can be issued where there is executive action unsupported by law or even in respect of a\ncorporation there is denial of equality before law or equal protection of law or if it can be shown that\naction of the public  authorities was without giving any hearing and violation of principles of natural\njustice after holding that action could not have been taken without observing principles of natural justice.\n70.8 If the contract  between private party and the State/instrumentality and/o r agency of the State is\nunder the realm of a private law and there is no element of public law, the normal course for the\naggrieved party , is to invoke the remedies provided under ordinary civil law rather than approaching the\nHigh Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction.\n70.9 The distinction  between public law and private law element in the contract with the State is getting\nblurred. However , it has not been totally obliterated and where the matter falls purely in private field of\ncontract, this Court has maintained the position that writ petition is not main tainable. The dichotomy\nbetween public law and private law rights and remedies would depend on the factual matrix of each case\nand the distinction between the public law remedies and private law field, cannot be demarcated with\nprecision. In fact, each case has to be examined, on its facts whether the contractual relations between the\nparties bear insignia of public element. Once on the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of the\nactivity or controversy involves public law element, then the matter can be examined by the High Court\nin writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to see whether action of the State and/or\ninstrumentality or agency of the State is fair, just and equitable or that releva nt factors are taken intoconsideration and irrelevant factors have not gone into the decision-making process or that the decision is\nnot arbitrary .\n70.10 Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a\ndistinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision\narbitrary , and this is how the requirements of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of\nthe principle of non-arbitrariness.\n70.11 The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual\nobligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to adjudication of\ntheir rights by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes.\"\n20. The Supreme Cour t in Caretel Infotech Ltd. v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. [2019] 14 SCC 81 at\nparagraphs 37 and 38 held as under:\n\"Epilogue\n37. We consider it appropriate to make certain observations in the context of the nature of dispute which\nis before us. Norma lly parties would be governed by their contracts and the tender terms, and really no\nwrit would be maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In view of Government and\npublic sector enterprises venturing into economic activities, this Court found it appropriate to build in\ncertain checks and balances of fairness in procedure. It is this approach which has given rise to scrutiny\nof tenders in writ proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It, however , appears that the\nwindow has been opened too wide as almost every small or big tender is now sought to be challenged in\nwrit proceedings almost as a matter of routine. This in turn, affects the efficacy of commercial activities\nof the public sectors, which may be in competition with the private sector . This could hardly have been\nthe objective in mind. An unnecessary , close scrutiny of minute details, contrary to the view of the\ntendering authority , makes awarding of contracts by government and public sectors a cumbersome\nexercise, with long drawn out litigation at the threshold. The private sector is competing often in the same\nfield. Promptness and efficiency levels in private contracts, thus, often tend to make the tenders of the\npublic sector a non-competitive exercise. This works to a great disadvantage to the Government and the\npublic sector .\n38. In Afcons Infrastructur e Ltd. v. Nagpur Metr o Rail Corpn. Ltd. [Afcons Infrastructur e Ltd. v. Nagpur\nMetr o Rail Corpn. Ltd., (2016) 16 SCC 818], this Court has expounded further on this aspect, while\nobserving that the decision-making process in accepting or rejecting the bid should not be interfered with.\nInterference is permissible only if the decision-making process is arbitrary or irrational to an extent that\nno responsible authority , acting reasonably and in accordance with law, could have reached such a\ndecision. It has been  cautioned that constitutional courts are expected to exercise restraint in interfering\nwith the administrative decision and ought not to substitute their view for that of the administrative\nauthority . Mere disagreement with the decision-making process would not suf fice.\"\n21. It is true that the writ petitions filed against the State or its instrumentalities in relation to contractual\nmatters are maintainable. However , that general proposition has certain limitations. The Court exercising\njurisdiction under article 226 would have to consider the factors, enumerated above, among others, on a case\nto case basis, before exercising its discretion to hear a writ Petition, relating to contractual disputes, under\narticle 226 of the Constitution of India.\n22. Applying the above principles to the present case, the Petitioner has not been able to make out any case of\ndiscrimination or bias against the Respo ndents. The only ground that could be raised by the petitioner is that\nof an arbitrary action of the 2nd Respondent, in rejecting the bid of the Petitioner and allowing the\nRespondents to participate in the financial bids. It would now be necessary to see whether the said allegations\nhold.\n23. The first allegation of arbitrariness is the disqualification of the Petitio ner. Instruction No. 4 of\n\"Instructions to bidder\" in the tender document required the bidders to submit copy of the certificate of\nregistration of GST, EPF, ESI with the appropriate authority valid as on the date of submission of tender\ndocuments. It is the admitted case of all sides that the petitioner did not submit certificate of registration under\nthe GST Act. The defence of the petition er is that the Central Government had issued a notification exempting\nvarious services, including the primary activity of the petitioner from payment of tax under the GST Act. The\npetitioner's case is that in view of such an exemption from payment of tax, the petitioner need not registerunder the GST Act and as such does not have to possess a registration certificate under the GST Act to\nparticipate in the tenders called by the 2nd respondent.\n24. Section 23 of the Andhra Pradesh GST ACT enumerates the persons who are not liable to register\nthemselves under the said Act. Section 23 (1) ( a) reads as follows:\n\"23. Appeal to Special Appellate Tribunal.  \u2013 (1) Any dealer objecting to an order relating to assessment\npassed by the (Com missioner of Commercial Taxes suo motu  unde r sub-section (1) of Section 20 Joint\nCommissioner suo motu  under sub-section (4-C) of section 14 or under sub-section (2) of section 20 may\nappeal to the Special Appellate Tribunal within sixty days from the date on which the order was\ncommunicated to him.\nProvided that the Special Appellate Tribunal may admit an appeal preferred after the period of sixty days\naforesaid if it is satisfied that the deale r had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within that\nperiod.\n(2) The appeal shall be in the prescribed form, shall be verified in the prescri bed manner and shall be\naccompanied by a (fee which shall not be less than five hundred rupees but which shall not exceed two\nthousand rupees as may be prescribed.\n(3) The Special Appellate Tribunal shall, after giving both parties to the appeal, a reasonable opportunity\nof being heard, pass such order thereon as it thinks fit.\n(4) The provisions of sub sections (6), (7) and (8) of section 22, shall apply in relation to appeals\npreferred under sub section (1) as they apply in relation to petitions preferred under sub section (1) of\nsection 22.\"\n25. This would mean that a person is exempted from the requirement of regist ration if he is engaged in\nsupplying only those goods and services which are exempt from registration and does not supply any other\ngoods or services. If such a person deals in any other goods or services, he will not be eligible for such\nexemption.\n26. Sri Chittem Venka ta Reddy , the learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent submits that the\nsuccessful tenderer would be required, as per section IV of the Tender Documents, to supply medicines and\nother goods, which are not exempted under the GST Act, in the process of maintaining SNCUs, and for that\nreason the 2nd Respondent had required  all bidders to submit GST registration certificates. It is clear that in\nsuch a situation, the Petitioner would have to supply drugs and goods which are not exempt from levy of GST\nand the petitioner would require to be registered, under the GST Act. In the absence of such a registration\ncertificate, the action of the 2nd Respondent in rejecting the technical bid of the Petitioner cannot be termed to\nbe arbitrary .\n27. The second allegation of arbitrariness against the 2nd respondent is the refusa l to reject the technical bid\nof the 3rd Responde nt. The contention of the petitioner is that the 3rd respondent was one of the members of a\nconsortium, which was participating in the tender and could not have submitted  the bid as it was not the lead\nmember in the said consortium. This contention is disputed by both respondent  Nos.2 and 3. It is the specific\nstand of both these respondents that there is no stipulation in the tender docum ent that only the lead member\nof the consortium who filed the bid documents, and that the other members of the consortium cannot file the\nbid documents.\n28. Sri V.R. Reddy Kovvuri, learned counsel for the petitioner would seek to point out certain provisions\nwhere details of the lead member are required and where the lead member has to give certain assurances etc.\nHowever , this requirement cannot be taken to mean that the bid document has to be filed only by the lead\nmember . All such information and assur ances can always be obtained by any other member and file before the\ntender authority . As such it cannot be said that the 3rd respondent is disqualified on that count and the action\nof the 2nd Respond ent in allowing the 3rd respondent in participating in the financial bid cannot be termed\narbitrary .\n29. The 3rd Allegation of arbitrariness against the 2nd Respondent is that the 2nd respondent allowed the 4th\nRespondent to participate in the financial bid even though the 4th Respondent did not have the necessary\nexperience to qualify in the technical bid. Criteria No. 2 in the eligibility criteria set out under section-V of the\ntender document requires the bidder to have a minimum of three years experience in carrying out operation\nand maintenance of SNCUs in private  or public sector . The said experience being demonstrated by usersJYOTIcertificate regarding  satisfactory completion of assignments. The 4th responde nt had submitted a certificate\nfrom the NRI Academy of Sciences stating that NRI Academy of Sciences through the 4th respondent had\nprovided such services to CHC Seethampeta in ITDA area of Seethampeta, A.P, from March, 2018 to 13-8-\n2020 and the certificate from the medical officer of the area hospital Seethampeta that such services were\nbeing given at CHC  Seethampeta in ITDA area of Seethampeta from 14-8-2020 till 29-7-2021. This would\nshow that the 4th respondent has been giving services for more than three years required under the said\neligibility criteria.\n30. The conte ntion of the petitioner that such services were not in accordance with the contract between M/s.\nNRI Academy of Sciences and the State of A.P., has not been demonstrated by the petitioner . Except a\nstatement that it is not in accordance with the contract between the parties, the petitioner has not placed any\nmaterial before this Court to take such a view . Further , the requirement under the eligibility criteria is to\nascertain whether such a bidder would  have the experience and capacity to execute the contract if it is\nawarded to such a bidder . The certificates produced by the 4th Respondent do attest to the experience claimed\nby the 4th respond ent. In the circums tances, the contention of the petitione r that the action of the 2nd\nrespondent in this regard is arbitrary must fail.\n31. The Writ is dismiss ed. There shall be no order as to costs. As a sequel, pending  miscellaneous petitions, if\nany, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The second respondent herein  vide\nRef.GSTIN.No.37AAACG3608B1Z5, dated 6-1-2021, issued a show cause notice, calling upon the petitioner\nherein to show cause  as to why tax of Rs. 10,04,022/- should not be imposed, granting fifteen days time to the\npetitioner herein to file objections/ar guments from the date of receipt of the said notice. Admittedly , petitioner\nherein did not file any objections within the time stipulated.\n3. The only contention  advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the present Writ Petition is that,\nin contrav ention of the mandatory provi sions of section  75 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017S.K. JAIN(for brevity , 'the Act') in general and sub-section  (4) of section  75 of the Act in particular , the second\nrespondent herein passed the impugned order .\n4. On the contrary , it is strenuously contended by the learned Government Pleader that, having failed to\nrespond to the show cause notice issued by the second respondent herein, within the time stipulated, petitioner\nherein is estopped from questioning the validity and the legal sustainability of the impugned order passed by\nthe second respondent on 9-2-2021. In the instant case, second respondent herein passed the impugned order\nunder section  74 of the Act and rule 142 (5) of the Central Goods and Services Tax rules, 2017 framed\nthereunder .\n5.

In the instant case, though show cause notice was issued on 6-1-2021, asking the petitioner herein to submit\nobjections, in the considered opinion of this Court, second respondent herein, before resorting to the\nimpugned action, ought to have served on the petitioner the notice of personal hearing, indicating the date of\nhearing, according to the second limb of sub-section  (4) of section  75 of the Act.

Mukhairuddin, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Gadi Praveen\nKumar , learned Deputy Solicitor General of India for respondent No.1; and Ms. Sapna Reddy , learned counsel\nfor respondents No.2 and 3.\n2. This petition has been filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India assailing the legality and validity\nof the order dated 19-1-2022 passed by respondent No.3 cancelling the Goods and Service Tax (GST)\nregistration of the petitioner as well as the order -in-appeal  dated 28-12-2022 passed by respondent No.2\ndismissing the appeal  filed by the petitioner against the order of respondent No.3 dated 19-1-2022.\n3. Petitioner  before us is a registered partnership firm engaged in the business of rice milling. After coming\ninto force of the GST enactments, petitioner  got itself registered with the GST authority . In this connection,GKregistration certificate was issued to the petitioner bearing registration No.36ABQFM2144J1ZZ.\n4. Show cause notice dated 5-1-2022 was issued by respondent No.3 to the petitioner calling upon the\npetitioner to show cause as to why its GST registration should not be cancelled on account of non-filing of\nGST returns for a continuous period of six months. Subsequently , respondent No.3 passed the order dated 19-\n1-2022 cancelling the GST registration of the petitioner . However , it was clarified that such cancellation of\nregistration would not af fect the existing liability of the petitioner .\n5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 19-1-2022, petitioner preferred appeal  before respondent No.2\nunder Section 107 of the Central Goods  and Services Tax Act, 2017. On the ground that the appeal  was filed\nbeyond the extended period of limitation,  respondent No.2 declined to admit the appeal ; rather he dismissed\nthe same vide the order dated 28.12.2022.\n6. Though a further appeal  before the appellate  Tribunal  is provided under Section 112 of the Central Goods\nand Services Tax Act, 2017, we have been informed that such an appellate  Tribunal  has not been constituted\nin the State of T elangana. Therefore, the present writ petition has been filed.\n7. Issue raised in this writ petition is no longer res integra .\nIn Chenna Krishnama Charyulu Karampudi  v. Addl. Commissioner ( Appeals ) [2022] 142 taxmann .com 70/94\nGST 376 (Telangana) , which has been followed in subsequent decisions, this Court had remanded the matter\nback to the file of the primary authority  to reconsider and pass appropriate order after giving opportunity of\nhearing to the petitioner . It was held as follows:\n\"We have perused the order dated 19-4-2022. This is an order passed by the first appellate  authority\nunder section 107(1) of the CGST Act. As per subsection (1) of section 107 of the CGST Act, limitation\nfor filing appeal  is three months from the date of communication of the order appealed  against. Under\nsub-section (4) of section 107 of the CGST Act, the appellate  authority  may allow the appeal  to be\npresented within a further period of one month, provided suf ficient cause is shown by the appellant .\nThough the lower appellate  authority  may be right in holding that while it may allow filing of an appeal\nbeyond the limitation of three months for a further period of one month, therefore, by extension of\nlimitation beyond the extended period of one month delay beyond the extend ed period of one month\ncannot be condoned, we are of the view  that such a stand taken by respondent No.1 may adversely affect\nthe petitioner . This is more so because respondent No.2 had suo motu cancelled the GST registration of\nthe petitioner on the ground of non-filing of returns and as GST Tribunal  has not been constituted under\nsection 109 of the CGST Act, petitioner would be left without any remedy .\nWe further find that the issue pertains to cancellation of GST registration of the petitioner . In the facts\nand circum stances of the case, it would be just and proper if the entire matter is remanded back to\nrespondent No.2 to reconsider the case of the petitioner and thereafter to pass appropriate order in\naccordance with law .\nIn the light of the above and without expressing any opinion on merit, we rema nd the matter back to the\nfile of respondent No.2 to consider the grievance expressed by the petitioner against cancellation of GST\nregistration and thereafter pass an appropriate order in accordance with law. Needless to say, when the\nrespondent No.2 hears the matter on remand, petitioner shall submit all the returns as per the statue.\"\n8. Thus, following the above decision, we set aside the order dated 19-1-2022 passed by respondent No.3 as\nwell as the order dated 28-12-2022 passed by respondent No.2 and remand the matter back to respondent No.3\nfor a fresh decision in accordance with law. Respondent No.3 shall afford a reasonable opportunity of hearing\nto the petitioner while passing the fresh order on remand. In the remand proce edings, it will be open to the\npetitioner to submit the GST returns as per the statute.\n9. It is clarified that we have not expressed any opinion on merit.\n10. Writ Petition is accordingly allowed to the extent indicated above. No costs.\nAs a sequel, miscellaneous petitions, pending if any , stand closed.* In favour of assessee."}

No. 26/2019, dated 29-1-2019 in Form GSTR-\nASMT  13 insofar as imposi ng penalty of Rs. 4,27,19,192/- against the Petitioner and consequential\nproceedings  vide OC. No. 149/2020,  dated 12-8-2020, demanding the Petitioner to pay penal ty as being\nillegal, arbitrary and contrary to the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ['CGST\nAct'], and the Andhra Pradesh State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ['AP SGST Act'] and violative of\nArticles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.\n2. The facts, in issue, are that:\n(i) The Petitioner herein is a Company and the deponent is the Director of the Company . The said\nCompany is manufacturer of Grain based Extra Neutral Alcohol and also bottles Indian Made\nForeign Liquor. The Petitioner after having got itself registered with CGST Act was dischar ging its\nGST liability since July 2017 and filing regularly monthly returns in Form GSTR 1 and GSTR 3B.\n(ii) While things stood thus, a notice came to be issued by the 5th Respondent, dated 15-1-2019, under\nsection 46 of CGST Act, for not filing the returns in GSTR 3B for the months of February 2018 toDecember 2018 and accordingly was directed to furnish returns within 15 days falling which the\ntax liability would be assessed under section 62 of CGST Act.\n(iii) It is said that, 5th Respondent,  vide its Order , dated 29-1-2019, and the Corrigendum, dated 12-2-\n2019, issued assessment Order under section 62 in Form GSTR ASMT -12 ordering to pay the\nfollowing amounts.\n(a) Rs. 1,04,53,566/- towards IGST , Rs. 1,56,94,370/-towards CGST , Rs. 1,56,94,370/-\ntowards GS/UT GST and Rs. 8,76,886/- towards cess;\n(b) Interest of Rs. 10,13,922/- under IGST , Rs. 14,38,004/- under CGST , Rs. 14,38,0 04/- under\nCGST , Rs. 14,38,00 4/- under SG/UT GST and Rs. 61,670/- cess under section  50 of the\nCGST Act/AP GST Act.\n3. The case of the Petitioner is that, he has paid total GST liability of Rs. 4,69,92,664/- for the period of\nFebruary 2018 to December 2018 and filed GST DRC-03, and having accepted the GST liability , interest and\nlate fees, as per the provisions of CGST  Act, imposing penalty of Rs. 4,27,19,192/- under section 122(1) of\nCGST Act, AP GST Act, is illegal. It is stated that, 5th Respondent has no power to impose such penalty as\nper section 62 of CGST Act.\n4. The Counsel furthe r pleads that, to impose penalty under section 122 of CGS T Act, the procedure under\nsections 73 and 74 is required to be followed. It is further averred that, without giving any opportunity or\nnotice about imposing penalty , passing an order directing the Petitioner to pay Rs. 4,27,19,191/- as penalty is\nillegal, improper and incorrect.\n5. The Counsel furthe r pleads that, 3rd Respondent has issued a Garnishee Order , dated 31-7-2020, to the 6th\nRespondent and also to 7th and 8th Respondents for Rs. 5,53,54,009/-, which includes, tax, interest and\npenalty . Apart from  issuing another Garnishee Order by the 4th Responden t to 9th Respondent for Rs.\n5,45,71,563/-In other words, the plea of the Petitioner appears to be three fold, viz., 1] Imposing penalty\nwithout issuing notice, as violative of principles of natural justice; 2] Jurisdiction on the 5th Respondent to\nimpose penalty; 3] that having collected the amounts by way of tax, interest and attaching properties and\ncollecting the due amount by issuing garnishee orders, directing the Petitioner once again to pay the very\nsame amount would be illegal.\n6. The same  is disputed by the Counsel appearing for the Revenue. A counter came to be filed stating that, the\nPetitioner herein has failed to pay GST  liabilities and also file periodical returns i.e. GST R-3B for vario us\nmonths within the prescribed due dates. It is stated that, though, the Petitioner has filed GSTR-1 for certain\nmonths, but failed to file GSTR-3B returns for the corresponding months.\n7. In view of the above, it is urged that, no revenue is actually transferred to the Government, and on the other\nhand, the customers to whom the Petitioner has issued invoices would avail GST Credit, which the Petitioner\nhas not paid. He further pleads that, failure on the part of the Petitioner to submit GSTR 3B returns within the\nprescribed time lead the authorities to recover the GST liability , which is inclusive of penalty .\n8. Refe rring to the various factual figures, it has been stated in the counter that, the Petitioner has not paid the\namounts voluntary . He pleads that, there is no bar on imposition of penalty under section 122 of CGST Act\nwhile issuing assessment order under section 62 of CGST Act, and there is no room for discussion on Sections\n73 and 74 of CGST  Act. Having regard to the above, it is pleaded that the Writ Petition is liable to be\ndismissed.\n9. Section 73(1) of CGST Act, reads as under:\n\"(1) Where it appea rs to the proper officer that any tax has not been paid or short paid or erroneously\nrefunded, or where input tax credit has been wrongly availed or utilised for any reason, other than the\nreason of fraud or any wilful-misstatem ent or suppression of facts to evade tax, he shall serve notice on\nthe person chargeable with tax which has not been so paid or which has been so short paid or to whom\nthe refund has erroneously been made, or who has wrongly availed or utilised input tax credit, requiring\nhim to show cause as to why he should  not pay the amount specified in the notice along with interest\npayable thereon under section 50 and a penalty leviable under the provisions of this Act or the rules made\nthereunder .\n** ** **S.K. JAIN** ** **\n** ** **\"\n10. Section 62 of CGST Act, reads as under:\n\"Assessment of non-filers of returns.\n(1) Notwi thstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 73 or section 74, where a registered\nperson fails to furnish the return under section 39 or section 45, even after the service of a notice under\nsection 46, the proper officer may proceed to assess the tax liability of the said person to the best of his\njudgment taking into account all the relevant material which is available or which he has gathered and\nissue an assessment order within a period of five years from the date specif ied under section 44 for\nfurnishing of the annual return for the financial year to which the tax not paid relates.\n(2) Where the registered person furnishes a valid return within thirty days of the service of the assessment\norder under sub-section (1), the said assessment order shall be deemed to have been withdrawn but the\nliability for payment of interest under sub-section (1) of section 50 or for payment of late fee under\nsection 47 shall continue.\"\n11. It is to be noted that, section 122 of CGST Act which deals with \"Penalty for certain offences\" states that,\n\"wherever there is a violation, a taxable person shall be liable to pay a penalty  of ten thousand rupees or an\namount equivalent to the tax evaded or the tax not deducted under section 51 or short deducted or deducted\nbut not paid to the Government or tax not collected under section 52 or short collected or collected but not\npaid to the Government or input tax credit availed of or passed on or distributed irregularly , or the refund\nclaimed fraudulently , whichever is higher\".\n12. It is well settled that, as per the procedure contemplated under section 73 and 74 of CGST Act, a show-\ncause notice has to be necessarily issued and same has to be adjudicated following due process of law.\nThough, the learned counsel for the Petitioner pleaded that, such a notice was never issued, but no effective\nreply came to be made in the counter denying the said pleading.\n13. In-fact, a perusal of the material on record show that, a notice under Form GSTR-3A came to be issued,\non 15-1-2019, for filing of GSTR-3B returns for the period from February to December 2018 under section 46\nof CGST Act, which  was received, on 15-1-2019, itself. Without waiting for statutory period stipulated under\nthe Act, assessment Order came to be issued in Form GSTR ASMT -13 under section 62 of CGST Act, on 29-\n1-2019, directing the Petitioner to pay huge sum of money including penalty .\n14. In view of the circumstances referred to above, more particularly , the order came to be passed without\nfollowing the principles of natural justice, the Writ Petition is allowed setting aside the impugned Order , dated\n29-1-2019, and consequential proceed ings, dated 12-8-2020, and the matter is remanded back to the\nauthorities concerned to deal with the same afresh, in accordance with law, after giving an opportunity of\nhearing to the Petitioner . No Order as to Costs.\n15. Consequently , miscellaneous petitions pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Commissioner (ST) [2020] 115 taxmann.com 429/2020\n(42) GSTL 328 (AP .) (para 6).\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner challenges the rejection order dated 29.11.2022 passed by the 2nd\nrespondent rejecting the appeal filed by the petitioner on the ground that the appellate authority is not\nempowered to admit the appeal filed manually as prescribed under rule 108(1) of A.P. GST Rules in theSBabsence of production of evidence by the appellant regarding any notification being issued by the Chief\nCommissioner (ST), Andhra Pradesh, in terms of rule 108.\n2. Heard Sri S.Dilip Jayaram, learned counsel for petitioner and learned Government Pleader for Commercial\nTax representing on behalf of the respondents.\n3. While referring to the copy of the screen shot of the official website of the respondents, learned counsel for\npetitioner would submit that inspite of submitting the valid order (assessment against which the appeal was\nsought to be filed), it was only popped  up as 'Please enter valid order numbe r. If error persists, please call\nGST Helpdesk or log your issues on Grievance redressal Portal for GST and quote error number AP-\nFOWC1002' and thus, the efforts made by him to upload the appeal papers electronically could not be\nfructified and therefore, the petitioner submitted the appeal papers manually before the 2nd respondent in the\nmonth of January , 2022, after making a complaint about the technical  glitch  occurred while uploading the\nappeal and sending e-mail complaints dated 05.01.2022 and 06.01.2022. Learned counsel would thus submit\nthat the 2nd respond ent was not justified in rejecting the appeal on the sole ground that the petitioner has not\nsubmitted the appeal electronically and that for manual submission, there was no notification issued by the\nChief Commissioner .\n4. Learned Government Pleader oppose d the writ petition reiterating that since the petitioner could not\nproduce any notification issued by the Chief Commissioner (ST), Andhra Pradesh, facilitating the petitioner to\nsubmit the appeal in manual form.\n5. We perused the copies of the screen shots filed along with the writ petition. They would prima facie show\nthat the petitioner made an effort to submit the appeal electronically but due to unknown technical  glitch , the\nweb portal did not permit the petitioner to process the appeal electronically , for which the petitioner , in our\nview , cannot be penalized or deprived of filing the appeal manually . In this regard, rule 108 of A.P . GST Rules\nlays down  that an appeal to the appell ate authority under sub-section (1) of section 107 shall be filed in\nFORM GST APL 01, along with the relevant documents, either electronically or otherwise as may be notified\nby the Commissioner and a provisional acknowledgment shall be issued to the appellant immediately . True is\nthat so far as the submission of the appeal in 'otherwise' format, the rule says the notification of the Chief\nCommissioner is required. However , so far there is no such notification. Question is by that count, whether\nthe statutory right of filing appeal should be deprived to a concerned Assessee/Dealer .\n6. In similar circumstances, a Division Bench of this Court in W.P. No.9324 of 2019 Sri Siddhi Kalko\nBhagavan Stone Crusher v. Asstt. Com missioner (ST) [2020] 115 taxmann .com 429/2020 (42) GSTL 328\n(AP)  has observed that 'when substantial justice is pitted against technical  considera tions, it would be always\nnecessary to prefer the ends of justice' and allowed the writ petition filed by the petitioner therein and set aside\nthe appeal rejection order passed by the 2nd respondent therein. In our view , the said order applies with all its\nfours. Added to it, in the instant case, the facts would show that the petitioner has made efforts to submit\nappeal at first electronically and having  failed in such attempt only he submitted the appeal in manual form.\nTherefore, we are under the considered view that the writ petition deserves to be allowed.\n7. Acco rdingly , the writ petition is allowe d and the impugned appeal rejection order dated 29.11.2022 passed\nby the 2nd responde nt is set aside and the 2nd respondent is directed to admit the appeal if otherwise in order\nand process the same and dispose it on merits in accordance with law . No costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications pending, if any , in this case shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

By the first order , the petitioner was requested to workout the\ninterest payable on the entire amount inclusive of the ITC availed, and also penalty payable under Section\n122(iii) of the Good s and Services Act ('the Act', for short). By the latter order , the petitioner was directed to\npay the interest, failing which, the recovery proceedings would be initiated under Section 79 of the\nCGST/SGST Act.\n2. Mr. N.

This petition challe nges the order dated  16.12.2023 passed by the respondent No.1 for the period from July,\n2017 to January , 2023 as also the DRC-07 proceedings dated 16.12.2023 for the said period.\nConsideration for the period July 2017 to Mar ch 2018 :\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that so far as the period from July, 2017 till March, 2018 is\nconcerned, the controversy as involved in this petition is similar to the controversy which is attracting the\nattention of this Court in W.P.No.2851 of 2024, dated 05.02.2024 and the same order may be passed in the\npresent case also.\n5. Sri Shekar submits that he has no objection to the extent as aforesaid and the same order may be passed and\nthe time may be granted to file the counter af fidavit.\n6. The order dated 05.02.2024 passed in W .P.No.2851 of 2024 reads as under:-\n\"Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks permission of this Court to amend the cause title by impleading\nCentral Board of Indirect T axes, as a necessary party in the instant the writ petition.\nPermission is accorded. Let necessary steps be taken in this regard by the petitioner .\nMr.Bhaskar Reddy and Ms.Smitha Rohini, learned Assistant Government Pleader for respondent Nos.1\nto 4 and Mr.B.Mukharjee, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Mr.Gadi Praveen Kumar , learned\nDeputy Solicitor General of India, for respondent No.5. Hence issuance of notice is dispensed with.\nWhen the matter is taken up for hearing today , it has been brought to the notice of this Court that a\nsimilar writ petition was taken up for consideration by the Hon'ble Division Bench-l, of this Court in\nW.P.No.2123 of 2024, and the said Division Bench-l has passed an interim order directing the respondent\nauthorities not to pass any final order in the proceeding initiated pursuant to show cause notice under the\nchallenge in that writ petition.\nIn view of the fact that a similar matter is already been seized by the Hon'ble Division Bench-l, we are\nalso inclined to follow the same.\nAccordingly , let counter be filed within a period of three weeks and the matter be listed on 28.03.2024.\nLet no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner pursuant to the final assessment order passed which\nis under challenge in the instant case till further orders.\"\n7. Consequently we pass same order as in W.P.No.2851 of 2024, dated 05.02.2024, giving the same protection\nto the petitioner for the period July 2017 to March 2018.\nConsideration for the period April 2018 to January 2018 :\n8. With respect to the period from the April, 2018 to January , 2023, learned couns el for the petitioner  submits\nthat the ground of challenge which is for the period from July, 2017 upto March, 2018 is not available for this\nperiod.\n9. The preliminary objection has been raised by the learned Government Pleader that the order is appealable\nas well and the petitioner can avail the statutory alternative remedy of appeal.\n10. Learned counsel for the petitioner subm its that the petitioner filed the reply and in the reply affidavit, it\nwas subm itted that certain documents as mentioned therein were not returned by the Tax Authorities so as to\nenable the petitioner to file the proper reply .\n11. A perusal of the impugned order dated 16.12.2023, Ex.P1 shows that it mentions as under:-\n\"all the records and documents return back to the tax payer through their Auditor i.e. P. Nagesh on\n05.08.2023 which wer e submitted by the tax payer at the time of inspection\".\n12. After mentioning the details of those documents, it further mentions as under:-\n\"the entire 18 items of the above material is not the basis for any proposals of liability in the show cause\nnotice and therefore  there is no prejudice caused to the tax payer . And again no liability is finalised basedANURAG KUMARon the incriminating material and therefore no prejudice caused to the tax payer .\"\n13. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the said P. Nagesh was not authorized to receive the\ndocuments.\n14. The submission as advanced by the petitioner's counsel with respect to the return of the documents raises a\ndisputed question of fact. There is specific mention in the order that the documents were returned. The\nquestion whether they were returned or not returned or said P. Nagesh, was the person authorized by the\npetitioner to receive those documents or not, deserve not to be entered into and decided, in the exercise of the\nwrit jurisdiction, being the disputed questions of fact, might be requiring proof of so many other factual\naspects.\n15. Consequently , we do not find any ground of violation of the principles of natural justice, on the argument\nadvanced, so as to entertain the writ petition and to by-pass the statutory remedy of appeal.\n16. The writ petition is dismissed on the ground of statutory alternative remedy for the period with effect from\nApril, 2018 to January , 2023.\n17.

Narendar , J. - Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Government Pleader for Commercial\nTax for respondents 3 and 4.\n2. The petitioner is before this Court being aggrieved by the order of cancellation of registration on the\npremise that the same is pre-mature and that the material indicate a complete non-application of mind and an\nerroneous appreciati on and understanding of the law by the authority , namely the Directorate General of GST\nIntelligence (D.G.G.I.).\n3. The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the proceedings could not have been set in motion\non an unproven allegation.\n4. It is the case of the petitioner that an allegation was leveled against the petiti oner company alleging that\nthey have fraudulently availed of input tax credit without there being any corresponding movement of goods.\nIn sum and substance the petitioner is alleged to have claimed input tax credit, without there being any\nactivity enabling such a claim.AJAY5. Per contra, learned Government Pleade r would take the Court through the provisions of Section 29 of the\nAndhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short \"A.P.G.S.T . Act\") more particularly Sub-Section\n2(a) of Sectio n 29 of the A.P.G.S.T . Act and would contend that the contravention  of any law would enable\nthe competent authority to initiate proceedings for cancellation of registration. The provisions of Section 29(2)\n(a) of the A.P .G.S.T . Act reads as under:\n\"a. registered person has contravened such provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder as may\nbe prescribed.\"\n6. On a plain reading of the above provision, it is apparent that the provision invests the competent authority\nwith power to cancel the registration in the event of there being a contraven tion of the provisions of the\nstatute. The language deployed is as under - a registered person \"has contravened\". The word \"contravention\"\nis used in the past tense, implying thereby that there has been a finding rendered by a judicial or quasi-judicial\nauthority , that there is a contravention and finding recorded by the competent authority or Court that there has\nbeen such a contravention. In the absence of such a contravention in our opinion, the invocation of the\nprovision would be pre-mature.\n7. There is no dispute with regard to the facts involved in the instant case. The petitioner has been subjected to\ninvestigation by the D.G.G.I. and a reading of the impugned order , more particularly on page No. 3, where the\nauthority has quoted  what appears to be the proceedings before the D.G.G.I. In fact, it is observed that the\nManaging Director of the petitioner firm, who has recorded a statement under section 70 of the Central Goods\nand Services Act, 2017 (CGST Act) and has voluntarily confessed to the infraction and to the alleged incident.\nDespite the same, it is not in dispute that the said proceedings are still pending before the D.G.G.I. Pertinently ,\nno findings have been rendered by the D.G.G.I. holding the petitioner guilty of infraction of the provisions of\nthe statute.\n8. On a query to the learned Governmen t Pleader as to whether the proceedings are pre-mature or not, the\nlearned Government Pleader would submit that in the event, the proceedings ending and in favour of the\npetitioner , the registration would be restored. We do not find any such power vested in the instant authority to\nsuo motu  restore the cancelled licence. Be that as it may , this Court is not delving deeper into the said issue.\n9. As noted  supra , a bare reading of the provision would clearly demonstrate that the invoca tion of the\nprovisions of sub-section 2( a) of Section 29 of the A.P.G.S.T . Act, is available only in the event of there being\na determination by a competent Tribunal or Court holding that the registered dealer has in fact contravened\nthe provisions of the Act.\n10. We are inclined to adopt this view in view of the fact and the consequences that would flow on account of\ncancellation of registration. It is not in dispute and it is clearly admitted by the learned Government Pleader\nthat the petitioner firm is a going concern, implying and meaning thereby that the petitioner is also providing\nlivelihood to others. In the event, their registration is cancelled, it would automatically result in closure of\nbusiness and would sound a death knell to the productivity of the petitioner resulting in loss of livelihood, not\nonly to the management, but also to such other persons employed by them.\n11. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the harsh meas ure of cancellation ought to\nbe as a last resort and where the materia l would demonstrate that a fraud had been practiced with the intention\nof causing loss to the State and not as a matter of routine or a default measure.\n12. Accordingly , the Writ Petition deserves to be allowed in part and accordingly the above referred order ,\nimpugned, is set aside. Consequently , the registration shall stand restored. Further , liberty is reserved to the\nrespondents to re-start the process after the proclamation by a competent Tribunal or Court holding that the\npetitioner is guilty of contravention of the provisions of the statute.\n13. The W rit Petition is allowed in part accordingly . There shall be no order as to costs.\nIn view of disposal of the writ petition, the pending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand closed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

Siddharth Reddy  for the Petitioner .\nORDER\n \nU. Durga Prasad Rao, J. - The petitioner prays for writ of mandamus declaring the action of the 1st\nrespondent in cancelling the registration  of the petitioner under CGST/APGST Act, 2017 as illegal, arbitrary ,\nhighhanded and vitiated on account of violation of principles of natural justice and violative of Articles 19 and\n21 of the Constitution of India and consequently set aside the impugned procee dings of the 1st respondent in\nForm GST  REG-19, dated 15.07.2023 and pass such other orders deemed fit in the circumstance of the case.2. The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) Petitioner is a proprietary concern engaged in the business of purchase and sale of iron scrap and\npetitioner is registered with GSTIN No. 37AUVP A0929K1Z7 on the rolls of 1st respondent. The\npetitioner has been regularly filing monthly returns and making payment of taxes as per GST  Act,\n2017 after availing ITC.\n(b) While so, 1st respondent issued a show cause notice dated 23.06.2023 U/s 29 of SGST Act r/w Rule\n21 of CGST Rules, 2017 proposing to cancel the registration of the petitioner on the alleged ground\nthat the suppliers of the goods to the purchaser has availed ITC without actual receipt of goods and\nindulged in passing on such credit to the petitioner without supply of goods. The 1st respondent, in\nthis regard relied on certain alleged reports allegedly received by him in respect of few suppliers by\nthe respective GST  authorities. However , the petitioner was not supplied the reports allegedly sent\nby respective GST  authoritie s of the suppliers of the petitioner . In spite of his obligation under law\nto supply all the incriminating material  along with show cause notice to enab le the petitioner to\nrespond in an effective manner even the allegations leveled in the show cause notice were also not\ncorrect. They are baseless and contrary to the Assessment Order .\n(c) In respons e to the show cause notice, the petitioner filed a detailed objection s dated 26.06.2023\ndisputing the allegations made in the show cause notice and requested to drop the proposed action.\nPetitioner contended that if for argume nt sake the allegations of fake invoices and claim of ITC\nwithout movement of goods as alleged by the 1st respondent is admitted to be true and consequently\nthere is no purchase  of goods by the petitioner , equally there cannot be any sale of goods by the\npetitioner , inasmuch  as, without inward receipt of goods, there cannot be outw ard sale of goods.\nThus, if the 1st responde nt disbelieves the purchases, he should equally disbelieves the sales.\nHowever , without considering all these aspects, the 1st respondent passed the impugned order dated\n15.07.2023 cancelli ng the registration of the petitioner on untenable ground s and also on the\ngrounds which were not raised in the show cause notice. The impugned order is in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice as the alleged reports issued by the GST  authorities which are the basis\nfor issuing show cause notice were not supplied to the petitioner . It is further submitted that since\nthe petitioner was not properly advised,  he could not file a petition U/s 30 of CGST Act, 2017 for\nrevocation of registration.\nHence the writ petition.\n3. Heard arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Reddy and learned Government\nPleader for Commercial T axes for respondents.\n4. The pivotal argument of learned coun sel for the petitioner Sri V. Siddharth Reddy is that the petitioner\nnever indulged in bogus purchases or supplies to accommodate his suppliers to claim ITC fraudulently . While\nissuing show cause notice, the 1st responden t who claims to have relied on certain reports allegedly submitted\nto him by certain GST  Authorities, has not forwarded those reports to inform the petitioner with which of the\ndealers the petitioner made bogus trans actions to facilitate them to claim ITC wrongfully , so as to give an\nopportunity to the petitioner to submi t an effective reply . Learned counsel thus vehemently argued that\nprinciples of natural justice have been violated and therefore the impugned order liable to be set aside.\n5. Per contra, learne d Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes argued that the writ petition is not\nmaintainable, inasm uch as, the petitioner has alternative remedy to file a petiti on U/s 30 of APGST Act for\nrevocation of cancellation or to file an appeal against the impugned order before the Appellate Authority U/s\n107 of the APGST Act. Learned Government Pleader argued that without pursuing the alternative reliefs the\npetitioner cannot file the writ petition. Nextly , learned Government Pleader argued that the show cause notice\nis self-explanatory as the show cause notice contains the particulars of the non-existent dealers from whom\nthe petitio ner obtain ed bogus invoices and therefore the petitioner cannot claim non-supply of material and\nviolation of principles of natural justice. He thus prayed to dismiss the writ petition.\n6. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow ?\n7. POIN T: As can be seen, the prime contention of learned Government Pleader is that since the petitioner has\nan alternative remedy U/s 30 of GST  Act to file an application for revocation of cancellation or to assail theWASEEQimpugned order in the appeal U/s 107 of GST  Act, the writ petition is not maintain able. Per contra, the\ncontention of the petitioner is that required particulars are not furnished in the show cause notice dated\n23.06.2023 and thereby principles of natural justice have been violated and therefore, the writ petition is\nmaintainable. Law is no more res-integr a with regard to the maintainability of writ petition when alternative\nremedy is available to a party . In Whirlpool Corporation  v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai  [1998] 8 SCC\n1 = MANU/SC/0664/1998 the Apex Court has observed thus:\n\"14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is\nnot limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not\nonly for issuing writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, prohibition, Qua Warranto and\nCertiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution\nbut also for \"any other purpose\".\n15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has\ndiscretion to entertain or not to enterta in a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself\ncertain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court\nwould not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been  consistently held by this\ncourt not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely , where the Writ Petition has been filed\nfor the enforcement of any of the Funda mental rights or where there has been a violation of the principle\nof natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act\nis challen ged. Ther e is a plethora of case law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic\nwhirlpool we would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they\nstill hold the field.\"\n8. Thus , Hon'ble Apex  Court held that in certain contingencies viz., when writ petition is filed for enforcement\nof fundamental rights, or where there  has been a violation of principles of natural justice or when the\nproceedings impugned are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an act is challenged, the writ petition\ncould be maintainable in spite of availability of alternative remedy . In the instant case the petitioner banks\nupon the violation of principles of natur al justice to maintain the writ petition. In this context, a perusal of the\nshow cause notice dated 23.06.2023 shows that the 1st respondent has given required particulars of the non-\nexistent tax payers from whom the petitioner allegedly obtained bogus tax invoices. Therefore, we do not find\nvenom in the conte ntion of the petitioner that the show cause notice is bereft of required particulars and\nthereby the principles of natural justice  were violated. Admittedly , the petitio ner has alternative remedy to\nchallenge the impugned order which he did not avail. Therefore, we does not deserve any order in the writ\npetition. However , considering that the petitioner's registration has been cancelled and thereby he cannot\ncontinue his business activities, we deem  it apposite to give an opportunity to the petitioner to challenge the\nimpugned order either by way of filing a petition U/s 30 of the GST  Act or to file an appeal within a\nreasonable time.\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is dismissed. However , giving an opportunity to the petitioner either to file an\napplication U/s 30 of the GST  Act for revocation of cancellation, or to challenge the impugned order by way\nof filing an appeal and the petitioner can avail either remedy within 15 days from the date of receipt of a copy\nof this order , in which case the concerne d authority shall pass an appropriate order on merits after affording an\nopportunity of hearing to both parties. No costs.\n10. As a sequel, interlocutory applications if any pending, shall stand closed.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The petitioner's case succinctly is thus:\n(a) M/s. Sakthi Steel Industries India Private Limited, the writ petitioner herein , is engaged in the\nbusiness of trading the TMT bars, billets and ferrous scrap importing the iron scrap from foreign\ncountries. The company was incorporated at Chennai and obtained registration number there. The\npetitioner is a group company of M/s.

This parent company manufactures the TMT bars and billets.

Sakthi Steel Industries India Private Limited. Further , to have better control\nand operational efficiency , the petitioner obtained on lease Ac.2.71 cents of vacant land with built\nup area situated in S.No.15/3 of Vasanadu Gollapalle Village, Kuppam Mandal belonging to its\nparent company under Lease Agreement dated 26-11-2022.

The petitioner obtained GST registration No. 37AAVCS01 10M1Z2\non 6-1-2023.\n(c) The further case of petitioner is that the Deputy Assistant Commissioner (ST)-II, Palamaner circle\nvisited the business place of the petiti oner on 16-3-2023 and submitted his remarks, basing on\nwhich the 2nd respondent issued show cause notice dated 20-3-2023 with a vague allegation to the\neffect \"In case registration has been obtained by means  of fraud, wilful misstatement or suppression\nof facts \", the petitioner is directed to furnish reply within seven days\". The petitioner's  registration\nwas suspended w .e.f. 20-3-2023.\n(d) The petitio ner subm itted reply on 24-3-2023 submitting that the petitioner never indulged in any\nfraud or bill trading or movement of goods without invoice and requested to revoke the suspension\nof GST registration. Subsequently the 2nd responde nt passed impugned order dated 20-4-2023\ncancelling the GST registration of the petitioner accepting the field inspection report of the Deputy\nAssistant Commissioner alleging that the parent company and petitioner's company doing the\nbusiness in the same premises which is not maintainable; the registered business was not genuine;\nthe taxpayer obtained registration witho ut any independent place of business and falsely claimed to\nhave conducted business at the premises of M/s. Sakthi Ferrous Alloys India Private Limited which\nis not suitable for conducting the taxpayer's stated business activities involving TMT bars and iron\nscrap; that the taxpayer may be engaged in bill trading without proper receipt and supply of goods.\n(e) Aggrieved by the said order , the petitioner preferred appeal before the Appellate Additional\nCommissioner (Sale s Tax), Tirupati/1st respondent and said Authority dismissed the appeal by\nconfirming the dismissal order passed by the 2nd respondent.\nHence, the writ petition.\n3. Heard arguments of learned counsel for petitioner Sri N.Vijay, and learned Government Pleader for\nCommercial Taxes representing the respondents. Both the learned counsel reiterated their pleadings in their\nrespective ar guments.\n4. The point for consideration is whether there are merits in the writ petition to allow .\n5. Point : We have carefully gone through the impugned cancellation order and the appellate order . It must be\nsaid that in both the orders respondents 1 and 2 on the main observations that the parent and group company\nhave obtained registration in respect of same premises, the leasehold premises of the petitioner is not\nconducive for the type of business it has undertaken i.e., sale of TMT bars and billets, since it is the case of\nthe petitioner that all the goods supplied to its parent company were delivered  as and when the goods were\nreceived from suppl iers and the finished goods which are purchased from parent company are immediately\nshipped to the buyers and such is the business activity of the petitioner , there is no need to take huge land to\nan extent of Ac.2.71  cents when the same is not used for storing the goods, the Lease Deed dated 26-11-2022\nis an unreg istered document, have come to the conclusion that the petitioner obtained registration by playing\nfraud and involved in bill trading without actual movement of goods and genu ine invoices. Accordingly , the\ncancelation order which was passed by the 2nd respondent was confirmed by the 1st respondent.6. Be that as it may, section 29(2) of the A.P. Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 specifies the grounds on\nwhich the GST registration of a taxpayer can be cancelled. It reads thus:\n\"29(2). The proper officer may cancel the registration of a person from such date, including any\nretrospective date, as he may deem fit, where,\u2014\n(a) a registered person has contravened such provisions of the Act or the rules made\nthereunder as may be prescribed; or\n(b) a person paying tax under section 10 has not furnished returns for three consecutive tax\nperiods; or\n(c) any registered person, other than a person specified in clause (b), has not furnished returns\nfor a continuous period of six months; or\n(d) any person  who has taken voluntary registration under sub-section (3) of section  25 has not\ncommenced business within six months from the date of registration; or\n(e) registration has been obtained by means of fraud, wilful misstatement or suppression  of\nfacts :\nProvided  that the proper officer shall not cancel the registration without giving the person  an opportunity\nof being heard.\n[Provided further  that durin g penden cy of the proceedin gs relating to cancellation of registratio n, the\nproper of ficer may suspend the registration for such period and in such manner as may be prescribed.\"\nHence, it has now to be seen whether any or all of the above grounds are satisfied by the respondents to cancel\nthe registration of the petitioner in the instant case.\n7. It should be noted that the show cause notice dated 20-3-2023, which is the precursor for cancellation of\nregistration, only reveals that the registration of the petitioner is liable to be cancelled for the reason:\n\"In case, Registration has been obtained by means of fraud, wilful misstatement or suppression  of facts \".\nIt is need less to emphasize that the show cause notice is as vague and dubious as it could be without\nmentioning the requisite particulars constituting the alleged fraud, wilful misstatement and suppression  of\nfacts . The elements of fraud, wilful misstatement and suppression  of facts  may be of varied types. Hence, the\nnature of fraud, wilful misstatement and suppression  of facts  have to be sufficiently described so as to give an\nopportunity to the taxpayer as otherwise, it will be difficult for him to submit an apt and appropriate\nreply/objections. The public authorities must know that the issuance of show cause notice has an avowed\npurpose of stating the formal grounds of accusation so as to invite proper explan ation or reply from the person\nwho is accused of charges. This process is based on equitable principle of natural justice that no man should\nbe condemned of unheard. Mere issuance of the show cause notice devoid of requisite particulars does not\namount to proper compliance of the requirement. In that context, it should be mentioned that the show cause\nnotice dated 20-3-2023 has flagrantly violated the principles of natural justice. Therefore, the very foundation\nfor invocation of cancelation is feeble as it has no legal sanctity .\n8. Be that as it may, though the show cause notice is vague, the petitioner seems to have submitted its reply\ndated 24-3-2023 with requisite particulars to the best of its ability . It clearly stated that to maintain proper\nsupply chain and to have better control and operational efficiency on cost as well as convenience of\noperations, it applied for GST registrat ion in A.P. by obtaining lease of part of the property owned by its\nparent company in Kuppam, Andhra Pradesh. The petitioner mentioned that all the TMT purchases of the\npetitioner are from its parent company and sales were spread over to different States. Further , the majority of\nthe scrap iron which is procured by the petitioner from different countries is sold to its parent company . Most\nimportantly , the petitioner avouched that the complete details of the purchases and sales can be verified at any\npoint of time if the need arises. The petitioner further avouched that never ever, the petitioner committed any\nwilful fraud, bill trading or movement of goods without proper invoices. On such submission, the petitioner\nsought for revocation of the suspension of its GST registration.\n9. Then the impugned registration cancellation order dated 20-4-2023 reveals that the 2nd respondent having\nreproduced the above reply dated 24-3-2023, made the following observation:\"Examined the reply filed by the Taxable person with reference to the documents available on record in\nGST Porta l. The Taxable person has given the address of the present business place i.e., M/s Sakth i Steel\nIndustries India Pvt. Ltd. bearing GTST IN No. 37AA VCS01 10M1Z2, Sy.No.15/3, Ground, Sakthi Ferro\nAlloys India Private Limited, Factory , Gollapalli village, Vasanadu golla Palle, Nadimur\nGramapanchayath, Chittoor 517 425. In the same Sy.No. i.e., 15/1 ABC 16, 17/1AB 2A, VASANADU\nGOLLAP ALLEE, KUPP AM MANDAL, Chittoor , 517425 there was also another Registration bearing\nGSTIN No. 37AAJC S3251K1Z2 has taken registration for doing business as under which is under the\nterritorial jurisdiction of Special circle-2.\nThe present Registration which was issued under the name and style of Ms. Sakthi Steel Industries\nPrivate Limited is also doing the same business in the same premises of M/s Sakthi Ferro Alloys India\nPrivate Limited (GSTIN No. 37AAJCS3251K1Z2) which is not maintainable. Further the Field Visit\nOfficer submitted his report stating that \"Upon verification of the place of Business, it was noticed that\nthe registered business was not genuin e. The Tax Payer obtained Registration  without an independent\nplace of business and falsely claimed to be conducting business at the premises of M/s. Sakthi Ferro\nAlloys Pvt. Ltd, which is not suitable for conducting the Tax Payer's stated business activities involving\nTMT bars and Iron Scrap. It is suspected that the tax Payer may be engaged in bill trading without proper\nreceipt and supply of goods. Finally recommended that the firm is not genuin e and recommended for\nsuomoto cancelation.\"\nIn view of the above and as per Field Visit Report of the Dy. Assistant Commis sioner (ST-II), Palamaner\nCircle, Palamaner , it is a fact that there  were Two Registrations for the same commodity existing in the\nsame place of busine ss reveals that the place of business now shown is not suite d for the present business\nactivities and hence recommended for cancellation.\"\n10. Thus, the observations of the 2nd responde nt would reveal that mainly basing on the fact that the\nregistration of the petitioner and its parent company emanate from same premises, the 2nd respondent, without\nverifying the records to know whether the petitioner involved in issuing and obtaining the fake invoices and\ndoing fake business to avoid tax, came to the conclusion that the place of busin ess shown by the petitioner is\nnot suited for the present business activities and hence, recommended for cancelation. We are unable to\ncomprehend, even if the place of business of the petitioner for argument sake is not conducive for its business,\nhow the said fact can be treated as sufficient to conclude that the petitioner obtained registration by\ncommitting fraud or wilful misstatemen t or suppression  of facts . It should not be forgotten that whether the\npetitioner is involved in bill trading without proper receipt and supply of goods  can be determined only after\nthorough examination of relevant records such as account books, e waybills, transportation particulars, toll\nplaza particulars etc. However , in spite of the petitioner's submission that the complete details of purchases\nand sales can be verified at any point of time, the 2nd respondent without resorting to such logical and legal\nexercise, simply carried away by the recommendations of the Inspecting Authority i.e., Deputy Assistant\nCommissioner who on a conjuncture suspected that the taxpayer may be engaged in bill trading without\nproper receipt and supply of goods, for which there is no proper basis. Therefore, the impugned registration\ncancellation order is not sustainable in the eye of law .\n11. Then we have perused the appellate order passed by the 1st respondent. Needless to emphasize that the\nsaid authority also committed the same mistake in confirming the order of the 2nd respondent without\nconsidering a logical question as to how the mere commonality of the location of the petitioner and parent\ncompany itself is sufficient to hold that the petitioner has committed fraud in obtaining registration and\ninvolved in bill trading, without the scrutiny of the relevant records. Therefore, the appellate order is also\nliable to bet set aside.\n12. Accordin gly, the Writ Petition is allowed and the cancellation order dated 20-4-2023 passed by 2nd\nrespondent and the appellate order dated 7-7-2023 passed by 1st respondent are set aside with a direction to\nthe respondent authorities to restore the GST registration of the petitioner within one (1) week from the date\nof receipt of a copy of this order . This order , however , will not preclude the authorities to issue proper show\ncause notice afresh with requisite particulars inviting explanation of petitioner and conduct enquiry by\nfollowing due process of law and pass an appropriate order in accordance with the governing law and rules.\nNo costs.\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, pending if any shall stand closed.RITA\n*In favour of assessee."}

Though many prayers have been made in the writ petition but at the time of arguments learned counsel\nfor the petitioner submits that the respondent authorities may be directed to process the petitioner's application\nwhich has already been submitted for refund of Input Tax Credit which may redress the grievance of the\npetitioner . The prayer ( a) is to that ef fect.\n5. On the petitioner's application for refund, a deficiency memo dated 31-12-2019 (Ex.P9) was issued with the\nremarks that no supporting documents were attached. The Taxpayer was advised to file a fresh refund\napplication rectifying the deficiencies . The petitioner's case is that since the portal was closed, fresh\napplication could not be filed on portal and the deficiencies pointed out could  also not be removed and the\nrespondent authorities would not accept manual filing.\n6. Learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax submits that the stand taken in the counter af fidavit is the\nsame as in the deficiency memo. He submits that the Letter of Undertaking (LUT) was not uploaded. The\nfresh application was also filed without filing of LUT which is required under section 16(3)( a) of the IGST\nAct, 2017 r/w Rules 89 to 96-A of the Central goods and Services T ax Rules, 2017.\n7. On 24-4-2024 this Court passed the following order:\n\"The submission advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that as per Ex.P4, the petitioner\nhad successfully saved GST RFD - 11 - Application for furnishing Letter of Undertaking for export of\nGoods and Services and the same could be retrieved, but as after receipt of the deficiency memo, the\npetitioner tried to submit, the portal was closed.

Sekhar , learned Government Pleader , list on 1-5-2024, to enable\nhim to obtain instruc tions, if the petition er's fresh application for furnishing the letter of undertaking can\nbe entertained manually .\"\n8. Learned Government Pleader submits that the claim for refund is to be made on portal and the deficiency\nrequired to be remo ved was also to be on portal. However , it is not contested that as the portal is closed, the\npetitioner cannot use the portal for the claim in question.\n9. The rules of procedure are handmade of justice. They are for effective and timely redressal of the\ngrievance. They are not for destroying the rights or to defeat the legitimate claims. If the petitioner could not\ndo the needful on portal in time for the reasons disclosed, he cannot be denied of his right for consideration of\nthe claim for refund under the statute.\n10.

Vinod Kumar , J. - This Writ Petition is filed primarily assailing the Order -in- Appario Retail (P.) Ltd. v.\nUnion of India  [Appeal No. HYD -GST -RRC-APP-091-20-21 (APP I), dt.29-12-2020], passed by the 4th\nrespondent, whereby the said respondent had set aside the order passed by the 5th respondent in Appeal No.\n03/2020-RR(GST)JC-D-D, dt.24-6-2020, denying the refund of excess amount lying to the credit of electronic\ncash ledger of the petitioner maintained  under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, 'the\nCGST Act').\n2. The petitioner contends that it is engag ed in the business of trading of electronic goods over e-commerce\nplatform by obtaining registration under the provisions of Goods and Service Tax Laws; that the petitioner\nprocures electronic goods from various vendors based on forecasted demand of business and maintains huge\ninventory for the purpose of ensuring timely deliveries; that as a result of purchases effected by it, a very high\nbalance of input tax credit of GST paid on its purchases is available in the electronic credit ledger; that on\nreceiving orders through Electronic Commerce Operator (for short, 'ECO'), the sale is affected through ECO\nand goods are dispat ched to customers; and that the tax liability is dischar ged by the petitioner by debiting the\nElectronic Credit ledger .\n3. The petitioner would further contend that upon effecting the sale through the e-platform of ECO, the\nconsideration is received by the ECO from the customers and is remitted to the petitioner thereafter .4. The ECO, before remitting the amount for the supply of goods effected throu gh it to customers, retains a\npercentage of amount from and out of such consideration received and deposits such amount retained by the\nECO with the Government in terms of section 52 of the CGST Act as 'Collection of tax at source'; and that the\nsuch deposit of amount made by the ECO with the Government is allowed to be claimed as credit by the\npetitioner in the electronic cash ledger of the petitioner , on the basis of the statement filed by ECO in Form\nGSTR-8 in terms of rule 67 of the Central Goods and Services T ax Rules, 2017 (for short, 'the CGST Rules').\n5. The petiti oner also contends that due to maintenance of huge inventory on account of purchases affected to\nmeet the forecasted demand, the petitioner invariably has excess balance of ITC in its electronic credit ledger ,\nwhich is utilized for dischar ge of GST liability , as and when sale of goods is effected through ECO, and\ntherefore, the amount retained by the ECO and deposited with the Government under section 52 of the CGST\nAct, as tax collected at source and reflected in petitioner's electronic cash ledger remains unutilized; that the\nsaid unutilized balance in the petitioner's electronic cash ledger can be claimed as refund in terms of section\n49(6) read with section 54 of the CGST  Act; and that the said balance amount in the electronic cash ledger is\nbeing refunded to the petitioner throughout India where it has operations, including in the State  of Telangana.\n6. It is furth er contended that the electronic cash ledger of the petitioner maintain ed on the GST portal is akin\nto e-walle t, where the e-valet holder keeps its money to be appropriated against a specific liability to be\ndischar ged and if the remains unutilized, it can claim credit back of the same to its account.\n7. The petitioner contends that as the balance in electronic cash ledger was being refunded to it previously ,\neven in respect of period October , 2018, the petitioner filed refund claim in Form CGST RFD-01A on 20-5-\n2019 for the period October , 2018, of the excess balance accumulated in electronic cash ledger of Rs.\n1,17,29,989/- (IGST of Rs. 73,08,531/-, CGST of Rs. 22,10,729/- and SGST of Rs. 22,10,729/-) in terms of\nsection 54 of the CGST Act read with rule 89 of the CGST Rules; that the said refund application was\nadjudicated by the 5th respondent and a refund sanction order was passed granting refund of entire amount\nclaimed as per refund application  vide order No. RFD CGST 28/2019 dt.18-9-2019.\n8. The petitioner contends that, upon the 5th respondent sanctioning the refund of excess amount available in\nthe electronic cash ledger , the 3rd respondent examined the said refund sanction order dt.18-9-2019 and\npassed review order  dt.09-6-2020 observing that the refund was sanctioned without examining whether the\nprinciple of \"unjust enrichment\" has been complied with as required under section 54(5) read with section\n54(8) of the CGST Act, and the impugned refund sanction order is legally improper , and authorized the\nadjudicating authority for filing an appeal before the Commissioner as provided under the CGST Act.\n9. It is contended that based on the said authorization granted by the 3rd respondent, the 5th respondent, who\ninitially passed the refund sanction order , filed an appeal before the 4th respondent on 24-6-2020; that upon\nfiling of the said appeal by the 5th respondent, the petitioner filed Memorandum of Cross Objections on 19-\n10-2020 contending that the TCS amount collected by the ECO and deposited with the Government represents\nthe portion of the consideration receivable by the petitioner for supplies made through ECO; that the balance\nin electron ic cash ledger is the amount of the consideration receivable by the petitioner and it is entitled to\nclaim refund of the same under the category of 'refund of excess balance of electronic cash ledger'.\n10. The petitioner also contends that the CBIC,  vide Circular  No. 125/44/2019/GST , dt.18-1 1-2019, has\nclarified that refund of excess balance in electronic cash ledger arising on account of TCS can be claimed\nunder the category of 'refund of excess balance in electronic cash ledger' and that a CA certificate was also\nfurnished in terms of rule 89(2)( n) of the CGST Rule s, in support of the fact that incidence of amount paid\nand claimed as refund, i.e. TCS, credited to electronic cash ledger , has not been passed to any other person.\n11. The petitioner further contends that the 4th respondent, after granting personal hearing on 23-10-2020\npassed the impugne d Order -in-Appeal setting aside the refund sanction order dt.18-9-2019 and rejected the\nrefund claim.\n12. The 4th respondent, by the impugned Order -in-Appeal, has held that there is no provision under section\n54(1) for refund of TCS under deposited section 52 of the CGST Act; that the Circular  dt.18-1 1-2019 allows\nrefund of TCS - TDS, only when the same has been erroneously deposited in excess, under wrong head; that\nas the case of the petitioner is not an erroneous deposit in excess under wrong head, refund would not be\nadmissible, that the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) issued by the CBIC are not binding  on the Appellate\nAuthority , and that there is a remedy of further appeal before the 2nd respondent.13. The petitioner contends that, though the impugned Order -in-Appeal can be appealed before the Hon'ble\nGoods and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, the said Appellate authority has not been constituted in the State\nof Telangana, as on date, even though more than three years have passed by after the introduction of GST with\neffect from 1-7-2017. Thus, it is claimed that the petitioner is invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of this\nCourt under article 226 of the Constitution of India, assailing the correctness of the impugned order -in-appeal\npassed by the 4th respondent.\n14. Counter affidavit deposed to by the 3rd respondent on behalf of the respondents 1, 3, 4 and 5 has been\nfiled.\n15. By the said coun ter-affidavit filed, the respondents contend that the present writ petition is not\nmaintainable, inasm uch as there is an effective remedy of appeal before the Appellate Tribunal provided\nunder section 109 of the CGST Act; that though the regional GST Tribunal has not been established as on\ndate, by virtue of the order issued by CBIC,  vide order No. 9/2019-C entral Tax dt.03-12-2019, the three\nmonths period for filing of appeal has to be considered from the date of communication of the order or the\ndate on which the President or the State  President, as the case may be, of the Appellate Tribunal, after its\nconstitution under section 109 of the CGST Act, enters office; that the CBIC by its Circular  No. 132/2/2020-\nGST dt.18-3-2020 further clarified the issue of filing appeal before the Appellate Tribunal; that the time limit\nto make application  to the Appellate Tribunal will be counted from the date on which the President or the\nState  President enters the office and that the appellate authority may dispose of all the pending appeals\nexpeditiously without waiting for the constitution of the Appellate T ribunal.\n16. On the basis of the above, the respondents claim that the petitioner is expected to first exhaust the channel\nof appeal before the Appellate Tribunal and not by way of filing the present writ petition under article 226 of\nthe Constitution of India.\n17. The respo ndents also contend that the amount deducted by the ECO from the consideration payable to the\nsupplier under section 52 of the CGST Act and deposited with the Central Government is not a 'tax' or that it\nis the liability of the petitioner; thus, the TCS is not an amount which is paid by the assessee and the refund\nthereof in terms of section 54(1) of the CGST Act or proviso thereto is not provided; and that the amount\ndeposited by the ECO with the Government is to be utilized only for payment of tax by the supplier for his\noutward supplies, and section 52 of the CGST Act does not envisage refund of such amount.\n18. The respondents would contend that the answer provided to Question No. 24 of FAQs also specifies that\nthe refund  is to be in accordance with the provisions of section 54(1) of the CGST Act, which applies only to\nthe amount paid by a claimant into the electronic cash ledger , but not the amount which has been deducted\nand deposited by ECO, and therefore, the clarification in the form of answer to Question No. 24 of FAQs is\nnot applicable to the petitioner .\n19. The respondents also seek to rely on the extension of limitation granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nCognizance for Extension of Limitation , In re [2020] 117 taxmann .com 66, to conten d that the appeal filed\nbefore the 4th respondent was in time and not hit by limitation.\n20. We have taken note of the contentions ur ged by the respective parties.\n21. Heard Sri G. Shiv Das, learned Senio r Counsel appearing for Sri G. Prahlad, learned counsel for the\npetitioner; Sri B. Narasimha Sharma, learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for respondent Nos.1, 3, 4\nand 5; and Sri Namavarapu Rajeshwar Rao, learned Assistant Solicitor General, appearing for respondent No.\n2.\n22. Befo re adverting to the contentions urged before us, it is necessary to note the relevant provisions under\nthe CGST Act.\n23. Chapter I is the Preliminary chapter and under section to definitions are provided. Section 2(21) defines\n'central tax'; section 2(43) defines 'electronic cash ledger'; section 2(46) defines 'electronic credit ledger';\nsection 2(84) defines the 'person' and includes 14 categories who are considered as 'person'; section 2(94)\ndefines 'a registered person'; section 2(107) defines 'a taxable person'.\n24. Chapter III deals with Levy and colle ction of Tax. Section 9 thereunder is the charging section which\nauthorizes the levy and collection of tax called 'Central Goods and Services T ax'.\n25. Chapter X deals with Payment of Tax. Section 49 deals with payment of tax, interest, penalty , fee or any\nother amounts; Section 51 deals with 'Tax deduction at source'; Section 52 deals with 'Collection of tax atsource'.\n26. Chapter XI deals with Refunds. Section 54 thereof deals with 'refund of tax'.\n27. The 'electronic cash ledger' as defined in section 2(43) of the CGST Act makes a reference to the\nelectronic cash ledger referred to in sub-section (1) of section 49 thereof. Section 49(1) of the CGST Act reads\nas under:\n'(1) Every deposit made towards tax, interest, penalty , fee or any other amoun t by a person by internet\nbanking or by using debit or credit cards or National Electronic Fund Transfer or Real Time Gross\nSettlement or by such other mode and subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed,\nshall be credited to the electronic cash ledger of such person to be maintained in such manner as may be\nprescribed.'\n28. A reading  of the above provision indicates that every deposit made towards tax, interest, penalty , fee or\nany other amount using any of the mode of payment stands credited to the electronic cash ledger of such\nperson to be maintained. In order to make deposit towards any of the amount specified, the section 49(1) of\nthe CGST Act does not mandate such payment to be made only by the person in whose name such electronic\nledger is maintained. On the other hand , section 49 allows a person to deposit the sums into the electronic\ncash ledger of another person, subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed.\n29. Thus, a reading of section 49(1) of the CGST Act would indicate that it is not only the person in whose\nname the electronic cash ledger is maintained, but also other person can make deposits into the electronic cash\nledger . This would be evident from the language used in section 49(1), as while allowing deposit, reference is\nmade to 'by a person', and while giving credit to the electronic cash ledger , the word used is 'such person'. If\nthe intent of the section is to allow the deposit only by the person in whose name the Electronic Cash Ledger\nis maintained, the same could have been  mentioned by using the words like 'of the said person' or by stating\n\"his electronic cash ledger maintained'. Alternatively , the section would have used the terms like 'a registered\nperson' or 'a taxable person' as defined under the CGST Act.\n30. The use of the term 'by a person' for making deposit has to be given a wider meaning having regard to the\ndefinition of 'person' defined 2(84) of the CGST Act. On the other hand, the use of word 'such', which is\nqualified by the use of words 'shall be credited to the electronic cash ledger of such person to be maintained'\nconnotes a different and restrictive meaning, implying the person in whose name the Electronic cash Ledger is\nmaintained and credit is to be given. The above said position of law is also not disputed by the respondents in\nthe counter af fidavit filed.\n31. Further , section 52 of CGST Act deals with 'collection of tax at source' and mandates every ECO to collect\nan amount  calculated at such rate not exceeding one per cent, as may be notified by the Government on the\nrecommendations of the Council, of the net value of taxable supplies made through it by other suppliers where\nthe consideration with respect to such supplies is to be collected by the operator . Section 52(3) thereof\nmandates that the amount so collected by the ECO of the net value of taxable supplies made through it to be\npaid to the Government within ten days after the end of the month in which such collection is made. Sub-\nsections (4) and (5) of section 52 of the CGST Act mandates such ECO to file monthly and annual statements\nelectronically providing the details of outward supplies effected through it and the amount collected under\nsub-section (1) during the month and financial year .\n32. In the normal course of business, ECO would be required to remit to the supplier the consideration\nreceived by it, but for the provisions of section 52(1) of the CGST Act. Thus, it is by virtue of operation of\nlaw, the ECO is required to deduct and remit to Government, the specified percentage of amount from and out\nof the net value of taxable supplies effected, which otherwise is the value receivable by the supplier . It is in\nthis context, the sub-section (7) of section 52 specifies that the supplier who had supplied the goods or\nservices or both through ECO shall claim credit in his electronic cash ledger of the amount collected and\nreflected in the statement of the ECO furnished under sub-section (4) on a monthly basis.\n33. In the counter affidavit filed the respon dents have taken a stand that the collection of amount by the ECO\nfrom the net value of taxable supplies under section 52(1) is not a 'tax', as what is specified is the deduction of\n'amount' and deposit with the government. However , we cannot lose sight of the fact that the collection so\npermitted under section 52 is specified in Chapter X dealing with 'Payment of Tax' and the heading of section\n52 also deals with 'Collection of tax at source'. Further , it is also to be noted that section 9 of the CGST Act is\nthe charging section providing for levy and collection of tax called as 'central goods and services tax'. If thecontention of the respondents that the said amount collected under section 52 is not a 'tax', then such\ncollection would have to be treated as without authority of law, if the same does not partake the character of\n'tax', which is only permitted to be levied and collected by the char ging section i.e. section 9 of the CGST Act.\n34. Further, it is also to be noted that the said submission of the respondents is without taking note of the\nChapter and the section under which it is collected where such collection is defined as a 'tax'. Therefore, the\nsubmission of the respondents on this ground has to fail.\n35. Once it is held that the amount collected by ECO and paid to the Government under section 52(3) of the\nCGST Act is tax to which the supplier is entitled to take credit in his electronic  cash ledger under sub-section\n(7) of section 52, the provisions of section 54 of CGST Act would apply for claiming refund of the same.\n36. By the Counter affidavit filed, the respondents contend that refund under section 54 of the CGST Act is\npermitted in respect of the amounts paid only by the petitioner . As the balance in Electronic Cash Ledger is on\naccount of deposit made by the ECO, the petitioner is not entitled to claim refund of the balance since, it has\nnot been deposited by the petitioner .\n37. In order to appreciate the said contention urged, it is necessary to refer to section 54 of the CGST Act,\nreading as -\n(1) Any person claim ing refund of any tax and interest, if any, paid on such tax or any other amount paid\nby him, may make an application before the expiry of two years from the relevant date in such form and\nmanner as may be prescribed:\nProvided  that a registered person, claiming refund of any balance in the electronic cash ledger in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-section (6) of section 49, may claim such refund in the return\nfurnished under section 39 in such manner as may be prescribed.\n38. The section 54(1) of the CGST Act, is in two parts.\n39. Sub-secti on (1) of Section 54 deals with refund of tax and interest, if any, paid on such tax or any other\namount paid by him by making an application before expiry of two years from the relevant date. The claim for\nrefund contemplated under sub-section (1) is in respect of tax paid on outward supplies or such refund arising\non account of dispu te relating either rate of tax or exemption or pre-deposit. Thus, under sub-section (1) of\nsection 54 refund can be claimed by (i) any person (ii) of any tax or interest, if any, paid on such tax or any\nother amount paid by him.\n40. On the other hand, the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 54 of the CGST Act covers the second\ncategory of refund to be claimed by a registered person of any balance in the electronic cash ledger in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-se ction (6) of section 49. Under the provi so, there is no reference either\n'tax, interest, if any, paid on such tax, or any other amount' or \"paid by him\". It merely refers to a registered\nperson claiming refund of balance in Electronic Cash Ledger and nothing more. Thus, the refund under the\nproviso can be claimed ( i) only by a 'registered person' as defined under section 2(94) of the CGST Act, (ii) of\nthe balance in the electronic cash ledger .\n41. Ther efore, the section 54(1) covers two different classes of persons who can claim refund namely i) any\n'person' and ii) 'registered person'. Simil arly it also covers two different types of refunds namely i) tax, interest\nof any other amount and ii) balance in electronic cash ledger .\n42. The petiti oner is covered by class of person specified in (ii) and the refund claimed is also under (ii) type\nof refund specified above.\n43. The balance amount in the electronic cash ledger till it is appropriated by making payment towards\ndischar ge of liability of tax, interest or any other amount to the Government, would be the amount available to\nthe 'registe red perso n' in whose name the said electronic cash ledger is maintain ed. Therefore, the stand of the\nrespondents that since the amount collected by ECO under section 52 of the CGST Act is not paid by the\npetitioner by himself and therefore, it is not entitled to claim refund of the same, in our view , is totally\nmisplaced. As the petitioner is claiming  refund balance in electronic cash ledger , it is covered by the proviso\nto sub-section (1) of section 54 and would not fall under sub-section (1) of section 54.\n44. Further , it is also to be seen that the CBIC in the form of FAQs on TCS under GST issued on 20-9-2018\nhad by way of answer to Question No. 24 also permitted the actual supplier to claim refund of excess balancelying in his electronic cash ledger in accordance with the provisions contained under section 54(1) of the\nCGST Act. The clarification provided by the above F AQ reads as under:\n'Q.24: How is TCS to be credited in cash ledger? Whether the refund of such TCS credit lying in the\nledger would be allowed at par with refund provisions contained in section 54(1) of the CGST Act, 2017?\nAnswer: TCS collected is to be deposited by the e-commerce operator separately  under the respective tax\nhead (i.e., Central tax/State  tax/Union territory tax/Integrated tax). Based on the statement (FORM\nGSTR-8) filed by the e-commerce operator , the same would be credited to the electronic cash ledger of\nthe actual supplier in the respective tax head. If the supplier is not able to use the amount lying in the said\ncash ledge r, the actual supplier may claim refund of the excess balance lying in his electronic cash ledger\nin accordance with the provisions contained in section 54(1) of the CGST Act.'\n45. The above clarification provided by the CBIC in the form of question and answer, in our view , leaves no\ndoubt as to the entitlement of the petitioner to claim refund of the excess balance in its electronic cash ledger ,\nwhich includes the amount that has been collected by the ECO under section 52 of the CGST Act from the net\nvalue of consideration payable to the petitioner in respect of sales/supplies effected through it, as such amount\npaid to the Government is allowed as a credit in the electronic cash ledger of the petitioner under section 49(1)\nof the CGST Act and such balance being eligible for refund under section 49(6) of the CGST Act. Therefore,\nthe petitioner is entitled to claim refund of the balance in electronic cash ledge r under proviso to sub-section\n(1) of section 54 of the CGST Act.\n46. It is also the stand of the 4th respondent that the said clarification provided by the CBIC does not bind the\nsaid authority dischar ging quasi-judicial functions under the CGST Act.\n47. Befo re accepting the said plea urged, it is to be seen that the impugned order came to be passed on an\nappeal filed by the 5th respondent on the basis of the authorization issued by the 3rd respondent. It is not\ndisputed that the circular /clarification/instructions issued by the CBIC in exercise of powers under section 168\nof the CGST Act, binds  the 3rd responden t. Thus, if the clarification issued by CBIC binds  the 3rd\nrespondent, the same ought to have been followed while examining the corre ctness of the refund sanction\norder and before issuing authorization to file appeal thereagainst.\n48. Though the 4th respondent has taken a stand that clarification issued by the CBIC does not bind the said\nauthority , being an appellate authority , he ignored the fact that he is otherwise duty bound to examine the\ncorrectness or otherwise of the grounds in the appeal filed including the authorization issued by the 3rd\nrespondent for filing the said appeal, contrary to the clarification issued by the CBIC.\n49. The non-consideration of the said issue by the 4th respondent, in our view , is perverse, to say the least, as\nthe basis of the 3rd respondent issuing the authorization for filing of appeal, itself is contrary to the\nclarification issued by the CBIC. It is settled position of law that the circulars /instructions/clarifications issued\nby the board binds  all the authorities under the Act, as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nCommissioner of Customs  v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd . 2004 taxmann.com 1061 .\n50. Further , on the view  taken by us, as to the eligibility and entitlement of the petitioner to seek refund of\nexcess balance in electronic cash ledger , is also supported by a decision rendered by the Kerala High Court in\nRoyale Edible Company  v. Union of India  [WP (C) No. 22593 of 2020, dated 18-12-2020], wherein the\nKerala High Court also took similar view and directed the respondents therein to ascertain the excess amount\nlying to the credit of the petitioner in its electronic cash ledger , and after making provision for any known and\ndetermined liability of the petitioner towards tax, interest, penalty or other amounts under the Act directed the\n2nd respondent to refund the said excess amount to the petitioner .\n51. Now , turning to the issue of maintaina bility of the writ petition, though an effective remedy of appeal to\nthe Appel late Tribunal is provided under section 109 of the CGST Act, it is an admitted fact that the said\nTribunal has not yet been constituted, though more than 3 years have elapsed after the CGST Act has been\nintroduced. Thus, the petitioner cannot be compelled to wait for eternity to agitate its claim seeking refund of\nthe amoun t to which it is entitled to under the statute and also blocking its funds affecting its cash flows,\nmerely because of existence of (non functional) alternate forum/remedy on paper , by not invoking the\njurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution of India. Further , mere existence of alternative remedy is no\nbar for invoking the jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution of India, when right to carry on business\nis being impeded, resulting in violation of fundamental right as guaranteed under article 19(1)( g) of the\nConstitution of India.RITESH52. Thus , considered from any angle, the impugned Order -in-Appeal passed by the 4th respondent, cannot be\nheld to be a validly passed order for it to be sustained. For the reasons indicate d above, the impugned Order -\nin-Appeal is liable to be set aside.\n53. Accordingly , the writ petition is allowed. The impugned Order -in Appario Retail (P.) Ltd. (supra ) passed\nby the 4th respondent, is set aside; and it is held that the petitioner is entitled for refund of the balance in\nelectronic cash ledger as claimed in Form CGST RFD-01A, dt.20-5-2019, for the month of October , 2018, in\na sum of Rs. 1,17,29,989/-(IGST of Rs. 73,08,531/-; CGST of Rs. 22,10,729/-; and SGST of Rs. 22,10,729/-).\n54. Pend ing miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed in the light of this final order . No order as to\ncosts.\n*In favour of assessee."}

The prese nt Writ Petition came to be filed questioning the order in Form GST DRC-07, dated 17-11-2021\nas illegal, improper , incorrect  and violative of principles of natural justice.\n3. The facts in issue show that the petitioner is a Company carrying on business  in mechanical erection and\nfabrication of Cement and Steel plants. The petitioner is registered as a taxable person under the provisions of\nCentral Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (for short, \"CGST Act) and State Goods and Services Tax Act,\n2017 (for short, \"SGST Act\") with GST IN No. 37AACCH1 218C3Z4. It is said that the petitioner has been\nfiling returns regularly after adjusting the tax credit in terms of section 16 of CGST/SGST Act, 2017. The 1st\nrespondent in pursuance of the authorization said to have been issued by the 2nd respondent inspected the\nbusiness premises of the petitioner on 2-11-2020 and thereafter issued a notice dated 3-11-2020, invoking the\npower under section 73/74 of APGST/CGST Rules, 2017, assessing the tax payable to the petitioner as Rs.\n69,12,453/- in respect of the assessment year 2018-19 and Rs. 1,53,25,314/- in respect of the year 2019-20.4. The 1st respondent  is said to have issued a show cause notice dated 10-8-202 1 proposing to levy penalty\nand interest in additi on to the tax already ascertained by him through Form DRC  01A. The petitioner  herein is\nsaid to have given the explanation to the show cause notice mentioning the incorrectness  in the show cause\nnotice issued. Pursuant thereto, the authority passed an Order dated 17-11-202 1, which is impugned in the\npresent W rit Petition.\n5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner mainly submits that the order impugned in the Writ Petition is\nbereft of any reasons and the explanation given by the petitioner has not been considered. Accordingly to him,\nexcept extracting the contents of the explanation given to the show cause notice, there is no consideration of\nthe same while fixing the liability . He further submits that while the show cause notice is for payment of Rs.\n69,12,1 14/- under SGST and CGST Acts, the order impugned directs levying of Rs. 5,20,39,891/-as the\namount payable by the petitioner , which according to the petitioner is beyond the amount demanded under the\nshow cause notice.\n6. Sri Sai Kumar , learned counsel representing the respondents, on instructions, states that, the petitioner did\nnot respond to the show cause notice issued and as such the order impugned warrants no interference. He\nfurther submits that though the amount demanded to be paid is more than the amount demanded in the show\ncause notice, but the same in no way cause any prejudice to the petitioner .\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner , in reply, contends that apart from adding CGST and SGST , the authority\nconcerned has imposed IGST interest to a tune of Rs. 84,16,365/-, which is also beyond the purview of the\nshow cause notice.\nThe point that arises for consideration is that,\nWhether the tax demanded is in accordance with the procedure established by law ?\n8. As seen from the record, the show cause notice was issued on 10-8-2021, by the Office of the Assistant\nCommissioner (ST)(F AC), Tadipatri, demanding the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 69,12,1 14/- under CGST .\nOn the very same day, another show cause notice was issued demanding payment of Rs. 69,12,1 14/- under\nSGST Act.\n9. The petitioner subm itted his explanation on 9-9-2021 explaining the mistake committed by the authority in\narriving at the said figures. The representation was received on 9-9-2021. Thereafter , the impugned order\ncame to be passed on 17-11-2021 fixing the liability at Rs. 5,20,39,891/-. The said amount was arrived at after\ncalculating interest and penalty to be paid by the petitioner , on the amount demanded. Not only that, an\namount of Rs.84,16,365/- was added towards Integrated Goods and Services Tax ( for short, \"IGST\") which in\nour view is impermi ssible under law. It would be appropriate to extract the findings arrived at by the authority\nwhich are as herein under:-\n\"Hence, the orders are passed accordingly and levied supra cited IGST Tax of Rs. 84,16,365/-, IGST\npenalty of Rs. 84,16 ,365/-, IGST interest of Rs. 31,05,921/-, CGST Tax of Rs.69,09,201/-, CGST penalty\nof Rs.69,09,201/-, CGST interest of Rs.22,28,521/-, SGST Tax of Rs.69,12,201/- and SGST penalty of\nRs. 69,12,201/- and SGST Interest of Rs. 22,29,915/- total levied of Rs. 5,20,39,891/- (Rupees Five Crore\nTwenty Lakh Thirty Nine Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety One only) and the amount shall be paid\nwithin 30 (thirty) days without fail, lest recovery proceedings will be initiated. DRC-07 (system\ngenerated copy) is herewith attached\".\n10. It is also to be noted here that in case if the authority intend to add interest and penalty on the amount\nfixed in the show cause notice, separate notices ought to have been issued to the petitioner for the said\ndemand, which was not done in the instant case. Apart from that a perusal of the order would show that except\nextracting the explanation given to the show cause notice, there is no discussion raised on the objections. The\nobjections raised were overruled stating as follows:-\n\"The same is verified and arrived the actual tax liability as under:-\n2018-19:\u2014\n S.No. Description CGST SGST IGST\n 1 Tax liability declared in GSTR-9 18994781 18994781 276514\n 2 Tax paid through cash ledger as well as credit ledger 17521432 17518432 276514SB 3 Balance to be payable 1473349 1476349 0\nThe tax payer has claimed excess ITC during 2018-19 and the same was shown and availed in annual\nreturn GSTR-9.

It is also to be noted that, while dealing with the objections raised, the authority goes into the aspect of\nclaim of ITC alleged to have been made by the petitioner which was not the content of the show cause notice.\n12. Havi ng regard to the above circumstances, the Order under challenge i.e., Form GST DRC-07, dated 17-\n11-2021, is set aside and the matter is remanded back to the authority to issue fresh notice and there after\nproceed further in accordance with law .\nMiscellaneous Petitions pending, if any , shall stand closed.\n*Partly in favour of assessee."}

Maheshwari, CJ. - Being aggrieved by the order of Prohibition issued in Form GST INS 03, dated 21-\n12-2019 by the 1st respondent-Deputy Assistant Commissioner (ST), Jaggaiahpet unit, Nandigama Circle,\nBhavanipuram, V ijayawada, this writ petition has been preferred.\n2. Learned Counsel for the petitioner has advanced solitary contention emphasizi ng the jurisdiction of the 1st\nrespondent, who passed the order of Prohibition as contemplated under section 67(2) of the Central Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter be called as \"CGST\"). It is urged that the authority competent to pass theorder shou ld not be below the rank of Joint Commissioner while the order impugned has been passed by the\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner , who is not competent to pass the order of Prohibition, therefore, the order of\nprohibition so passed confiscating the goods is unsustainable in law .\n3. On the other hand, learned Government Pleader for Commercial T ax appearing on behalf of the respondents\nthough opposed the prayer , but on reference to the provision so contemplated under section 67(2) of the Act,\nhe consented to adjudication of the case on merits.\n4. After hearing the learned Counsel for both the parties, and looking to the fact that the issue involved\nregarding jurisdiction of the authority in the matter of search, seizure and confiscation, in the matter , has not\nbeen found from the order impugned, however , being a legal issue, it can be heard and decided on merits as\nrightly conceded by the learned Government Pleader for the respondents.\n5. In the present case, the order of Prohibi tion issued in Form GST INS 03 is under challenge. The said Form\nwas issued in terms of Rule 139(4) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules , 2017, which prescribes that,\nto carry out the purpose of the Act specified under section 67(2) of the Act, how it can be proceeded with. At\npresent, the provisio ns of the Act i.e., 67(1) and (2) of the Act are relevant. However , it is reproduced as\nunder:\nSection 67: Power of Inspection, sear ch and seizur e.\n(1) Where the proper of ficer, not below the rank of Joint Commissioner , has reasons to believe that--\n(a) a taxable person has suppressed any transaction relating to supply of goods or services or\nboth or the stock of goods in hand, or has claimed input tax credit in excess of his\nentitlement under this Act or has indulg ed in contravention of any of the provisions of this\nAct or the rules made thereunder to evade tax under this Act; or\n(b) any person engaged in the business of transporting goods or an owner or operator of a\nwarehouse or a godo wn or any other place is keeping goods which have escape d payment\nof tax or has kept his accounts or goods  in such a manner as is likely to cause  evasion of\ntax payable under this Act,\nhe may authorise in writing any other officer of central tax to inspect any places of business of the\ntaxable person or the persons engaged in the business of transporting goods or the owner or the operator\nof warehouse or godown or any other place.\n(2) Where the proper officer, not below the rank of Joint Commissioner , either pursuant to an inspection\ncarried out under sub-section (1) or otherwise, has reasons to believe that any goods liable to confiscation\nor any documents or books or things , which in his opinion shall be usefu l for or relevant to any\nproceedings under this Act, are secrete d in any place, he may authorise in writing any other officer of\ncentral tax to search and seize or may himself search and seize such goods, documents or books or things:\nProvided that where it is not practicable to seize any such goods, the proper officer, or any officer\nauthorised by him, may serve on the owner or the custodian of the goods an order that he shall not\nremove, part with, or otherwise deal with the goods except with the previous permission of such of ficer:\nProvided further that the documents or books or things so seized shall be retained by such officer only\nfor so long as may be necessary for their examination and for any inguiry or proceedings under this Act,\n6. On perus al thereto, it reveals that under sub-Section (1), where the officer not below the rank of Joint\nCommissioner has reasons to believe that the person has suppressed the transaction relating to supply of\ngoods or services or both or the stock of goods in hand or claimed input tax credit in excess to his entitlement\nor indulge d in contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or the Rules made thereunder with intent to\nevade tax under this Act, ( or) any person engaged in the business of transporting goods or an owner or\noperator of a warehouse or a godown or any other place is keeping goods, which have escaped payment of tax\nor has kept his accounts or goods in such a manner as is likely to cause evasion of tax, in that contingency , he\nmay autho rise any other officer of Central Tax to inspect any places of business of the taxable person or the\npersons engaged in the business of transporting goods or the owner or the operator of warehouse or godown\nas the case may be. Meaning thereby , under sub-section (1) of Section 67 of the Act, competent officer is the\njoint comm issioner , but in case, he has reasons to believe of the aforesaid facts, he may authorize any person\nin writing or any other officer of the Central Tax to inspect. As per section 67(2) of the Act, it is clear that anS.K. JAINofficer, not below the rank of Joint Commissioner , in pursuance to the inspection carried out under sub-section\n(1), or otherwise, has reasons to believe that any goods liable for confiscation or any documents or books or\nthings, which shall be useful for or relevant to any proceedings under the Act, are secreted in any place, he\nmay authorise in writing any other officer of central tax to search and seize or may himself search and seize\nsuch good s, documents or books or things. The first proviso makes it clear that where seizure of any good is\nnot practicable, then, he may serve on the owner or the custodian of the goods an order that he shall not\nremove, part with, or otherwise deal with the goods except with the previous permission of such officer. The\nsecond proviso deals with the documen ts or books or things so seized shall be retained by such officer only\nfor so long as may be necessary for their examination and for any inquiry or proceedings under this Act.\n7. In the present case, Form GST INS 03, which deals with the order of Prohibition, has been issued to the\nProprietor of MAT Parcel Service premises. However , this is an order issued under section 67(2) of the Act by\nan officer i.e., 1st respondent-Deputy Assistant Commissioner (ST). In the said order of Prohibition, nothing\nis mentioned,  viz., by which written order he has been authorized by of ficer so specified in section 67(2) of the\nAct. It is also the contention of the petitioner that even for the purpose of section 67(1) of the Act, in respect\nof the search includ ing the inspection, written authorization is required. It is conspicuously missing in the\npresent case. Therefore, the order of prohibition passed by the 1st respondent is illegal and without any\njurisdiction.\n8. After perusal of the provisions of the Act, we find much substance in the argument of the learned Counsel\nfor the petitioner . As per the provision s of section 67(1) of the Act, power of inspection is specified to an\nofficer not below the rank of joint commissioner . The said officer for the purpose of search as specified in\nsection 67(1) ( a) and ( b) may authorize in writing any other officer of Central Tax for inspection of any places\nof business of the taxable person or the persons engaged in the business of trans porting goods or the owner or\nthe operato r of warehouse or godown, as the case may be. Similar is the provisi on of section 67(2) of the Act.\nFor the purpose of seizure where the authority is having a reason to believe that proceedings of the\nconfiscation are required in the matter , to which inspection has been carried out, after recording the said\nreason, he may exercise such power for seizure by authorising in writing any of the officers of the Central Tax\nDepartment. In this view of the matter and looking to the order of prohibition so passed in GST INS 03, the\nsaid order passed by respondent No. l, without reference to the order of authorisation in writing, is illegal and\nwithout jurisdiction. Therefore, it is hereby set aside. It is made clear that this Court has passed this order\nlooking to the competency of the authority and having found that the power so exercised by respondent No. l\nis not in conformity with the provisions of the Act, but not on the merits of the case.\n9. With the aforesaid, the Writ Petition is allowed. No costs. As a sequel all the pending miscellaneous\napplications shall stand closed. However , the authority is at liberty to take recourse as permissible under law .\n* In favour of assessee."}

SeetharamaMurti, J. - This writ petition, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is filed by the\npetitioner seeking verbatim the following relief/s:\n\"\u2026to issue an order , direction or a writ particularly one in the nature of Writ OF MANDAMUS declaring\nthe procee dings of the 1st respondent vide C.No.V/30/18/2018-(GST Cell) dt.8-2-2019 in refusing to\nforward to the IT Grievance Redressal Committee the request of the petitioner company to consider carry\nforward of input tax credit as on 30-june 2017 a sum of Rs. 4,01,14,416/- as illegal arbitrary and\nunconstitutional and consequently set aside the same by further directing the respondents to either to re-\nopen and instate the facility of online submission of TRAN-1 to the petitioner or manually accept the\nhard copy  of TRAN-1 of the petitioner and allow the duty credit to carry forward the legitimate input\ncredit of Rs. 4,01,14 ,416/- to GST period i.e. 30-06-2017 and to pass such other order or orders as this\nHon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under the circumstances of the case.\"\n2. We have heard the submissions of Sri S.S. Bhatt, learned counsel, appearing for the writ petitioner; of Sri\nSuresh Kumar Routhu, learned standing counsel for Customs& Central Excise, appearing for the 4th\nrespondent; and of Sri B. Krishna Mohan, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India, appearing for the\nrespondents 1 to 3 and 5. W e have perused the material record.\n3. From the pleadings  of both sides and the submissions made by learned couns el for the petitioner and the\nlearned standing counsel, the following facts are discernible.\n4. According to the petitioner , the petitioner made an attempt for online submission of Form GST TRAN-1\nrelated to carry forw ard Input Tax Cred it [CFITC] of Rs. 4,01,14,416/-; but, the petitioner could not file the\nTRAN-1 due to technical glitches. Therefore, the petitioner made a representation, dated 29.12.2018, to the\n1st respondent stating therein that at the time of transition period for GST, the petitioner could not file TRAN-\n1 due to technical glitches and that the Accounts Officer, who tried to file the TRAN-1, suddenly left the\nOrganisation, without notice, and that, therefore, they are unable to produce the evidence for technical glitches\nthat they faced and requesting to consider claim related to CFITC,as on 30.06 .2017. The petitioner further\nsubmitted another letter , dated 02.02.2 019, along with a copy of ER-1 for the month of June, 2017. The\npetitioner filed WP.no.626 of 2019 before this Court to direct the respondents either to reopen and reinstate\nthe facility  of online submission of FORM GST TRAN-1 to them or manually accept the hard copy of the\nsame and allow carry forward of ITC. By an order , dated 29.01.2019, passed in the said writ petition, the 2nd\nrespondent was directed to verify the representation, dated 29.12.2018, and take appropriate action or pass\nappropriate orders in strict accordance with law, however , as expeditiously as possible. By letter , dated\n08.02.2019, the petitioner was informed that the petitioner had not produced any evidence that the petitioner\nwas prevented from filing the TRAN-1 in time and, therefore, the matter could not be taken up for forwarding\nto IT Grievance Redressed Committee [ITGRC] in view of the Boards Circular , dated 03.04.2018 in Circular\nNo.39/13/2018-GST . Further , according to the respondents, as per recommendations of GST Counsel, the last\ndate for filing of TRAN-1 was extended to 27.12.2017 vide orders, dated 15.11.2017, in Order No.09/2017-\nGST and 10/2017-GST and it was mentioned that the last date for submission of TRAN-1 and revised TRAN-\n1 was 27.12.2017 and that later a press note, dated 12.12.2017, was issued reiterating the fact that last date for\nfiling TRAN-1 was 27.12.2017. It is also the submission of the respondents that the orders were made\navailable in the official common portal and that after 23rd GST Counsel meetin g, on 10.11.2017, the order of\ntime limit was issued on 15.11.2017; and hence, the Accounts Officer of the petitioner should have\nimmediately made alternative arrangem ents for filing TRAN-1 on or before 27.12.2017; but, the petitioner\nfailed so to do and that in that view of the matter and as the petitioner has not produced any evidence\nregarding filing TRAN-1 on or before 27.12.2017, the department has not consi dered the representation,dated\n29.12.2018, as a technical problem; and, the same is also intimated to the petitioner on 08.02.2019.S.K. JAIN5. Thus, on one hand,  the petitioner submits that it could not file Form GST TRAN -1 electronically due to\ntechnical glitches and on the other the respondents contend that the petitioner was lax and did not avail the\nextended time and that there was no indication on record to show that the petitioner made an attempt to file\nForm GST TRAN-1 or bring the issue to thenotice of the department or GSTN before the last date of filing of\nForm GST TRAN-1, that is, 27.12.2017.\n6. In the light of the facts and submission s, the only question that falls for consideration is as to whether the\npetitioner's request can be considered and, if so, whether the respondents can be directed to either open the\nportal to enable the petitioner to now file FORM GST TRAN-1 electronically  or to permit the petitioner to\nsubmit manually , the typed Form GST TRAN-1 for acceptance by the respondents.\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner , placing reliance on the settled legal position, contended that GST\nsystem, at the releva nt point of time, was in a trial and error phase and that not only the petitioner but several\nother dealers like the petitioner were unable to even connect to the system on account of network and other\nfailures and that such situation is recognized by various High Courts and that, therefore, the petitioner's\nrequest merits consideration.\n8. Per contra , learned standing counsel forcefully contended thatthe petitioner is not entitled to the relief in the\nlight of the submissions of the department and because of the petitioner's failure to produce evidence like\nscreen shot to show that the petitioner made an attempt to file Form GST TRAN-1 before the last date of\nfiling of the same and the petitioner's further failure to bring the issue to thenotice of the department within a\nreasonable time.\n9. We have given earnest consideration tothefacts and submissions.\n10. It is beneficial to refer to the decision of the High Court of Delhi in Uninav Developers (P.) Ltd. v. Union\nOf India  [W.P. (C) No. 1377 2 of 2018, dated 29-7-2019] wherein the facts are as follows: - \"On account of\ntechnical glitches, the petitioner therein was unable to claim CENV AT credit in Form TRAN-1; and, the\npetitioner could not file TRAN-1 electronically due to technical glitches of GST Portal; and, when the matter\nwas placed  before ITGRC, it concluded  that the present case falls under the category of B2, that is, 'Cases in\nwhich TRAN-1 filing attempted for the first time or revision was attempted but no error/no valid error\nreported.' Thus, in the absence of evidence, the re-filing of the form by the petitioner was not allowed. The\npetitioner therein contended that the petitioner was unable to connect to the portal to submit the return in the\nfirst place and that the portal reflected the message 'error occurred in submission '.\"In the afore-stated decision,\nwhile dealing with an identicalissue, the Delhi High Court referred to the precedents and held as follows: - 'As\nobserved by this Court in several orders  i.e., in Bhar gava Motors  v. Union of India [2019] 106 taxmann.com\n200/74 GST 340, Kusum Enterprises (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  [WP(C) 7423 of 2019, dated 12-7-2019] and\nSanko Gosei Technology India (P.) Ltd. v. Union of India  [WP(C) 7335 of 2019, dated 12-7-2019] - 2019-\nVIL-341-DEL], the entire GST system is still in a trial and error phase and it will be too much of a burden to\nplace on the Assesse e to expect them to comply with the requirement of the law where they are unable to even\nconnect to the system on account of network failures or other failures.' Eventually , the Delhi High Court\ngranted the relief to the petitioner therein.\n11. In view of the facts and the legal position obtaining, we are of the considere d view that the petitioner's\nrequest merits consideration.\n12. Accordin gly, the Writ Petition is disposed of directing the respondents to eithe r open the Portal to enable\nthe petitioner to again file the Form GST TRAN-1electronically or in the alternative accept the Form GST\nTRAN-1 presented manually ,on or before 31.08.2019. It is needless to say that thereafter the petitioner's claim\nshall be processed in accordance with law .\n13. No order as to costs.\n14. As a sequel, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any , shall stand dismissed.\n*In favour of assessee."}

It reads as under:\n\"(i) a breach of fundamental rights;\n(ii) a violation of the principles of natural justice;\n(iii) an excess of jurisdiction; or\n(iv) a challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated legislation.\"\n6. This decision has already been taken note by this Court in the order in W.P.No.30212 of 2021 dated 22-12-\n2021.\n7. In view of the above decision, as the petitioner could not satisfy any of the circumstances enumerated\nabove and there is an effective alternative remedy before the appellate authority , this Court feels that the\nmatter does not require any interference.\n8. Further , in the present case, it needs a detailed examination of the elements in the taxing proposal and all\nthe points raised by the petitioner herein can be considered by the appellate authority . This Court finds no\nglaring illegality in the assessment order , which requires indulgence of this Cour t by exercising its jurisdiction\nunder article 226 of the Constitution of India, at this stage.\n9. Accordingly , the writ petition is disposed of with liberty to avail the alternative remedy available under law\ni.e., to approach the appellate forum. There shall be no order as to costs.\n10. Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, also stand disposed of.\n*In favour of revenue."}

The petitioner's case is thus:\n(a) Vide reference No.ZA3702220252053, dated 17.02.2022, the 1st respondent cancelled  the GST\nRegistration  of the petitioner w.e.f., 31.01.2022 for the reason of failure on the part of the petitioner\nto file returns for a period of six months prior to issuance of the show-cause notice dated\n02.12.2021.\n(b) Aggrieved thereby , the petitioner filed appeal  before the 3rd respondent and vide order  in Appeal\nNo.VIZ-GST -000-APP- 042-22-23, dated 25.10.2022, the appeal  was dism issed on the sole ground\nthat the appeal  was filed with a further delay  of two months and twenty days and as per Section 107\nof the GST  Act, the delay  could be condoned  for a period of one month and since the appeal  was\nexceeding the limitation , the appellate autho rity is not vested with the powers to condone  the said\ndelay  beyond  30 days. Accordingly , the appeal  was rejected for admission.\nHence, the present writ petition.\n3. Learned counsel for petitioner , Sri M.V .J.K.Kumar , would mainly ur ge that the petitioner has a good ground\nto seek for restoratio n of his registration  and in fact, he has mentioned the reason s for non-filing  of the returns\nand on a technical ground that appeal  was filed beyond  the condonable  perio d, the appeal  was rejec ted and\nsince the GST  Tribunal has not been constituted under section 109 of the CGST Act, the petitioner has no\nother go except invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. He would thus\npray to allow the writ petition and remit the matter back to the primary authority to consider the petitioner's\ncase and pass appropriate orders . He would rely upon the order  of the Division Bench of the High Court for\nthe State of Telangan a in Chema Krishnama Charyulu Karampud i v.

Learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes - II opposed the writ petition stating that the petitioner\nhas not filed the appeal  within the time and instead filed the appeal  beyond  the condonable  period and\ntherefore, the 3rd respondent has rightly rejected the appeal . Therefore, order  of the appellate authority suffer\nno legal flaw and the writ petition is not maintainable.\n5. We perused the record and also the decision in W.P. No.27071 of 2022. In similar circumstances, learned\nDivision Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana having considered the fact that GST  Tribunal has\nnot been constituted  under section 109 of the CGST Act and thereby , the petiti oner could not be left without\nany remed y, held that it would be just and proper if the entire matter was remitted back to the 2nd respondent\ntherein to reconsider the case of the petitioner and pass appropriate order  in accordance with law .\n6. Needless to empha size that the above  said decision applies with all its fours to the case on hand. The\npetitioner preferred appeal  but it was rejected for the reasons discussed supra. In that view of the matter and as\nthe GST  Tribunal has not been constituted as per the provisions of the Act so as to enable the petitioner to\npursue his further legal remedies, in the interest of justice, we consider it appo site to allow the writ petition\nand remit the matter back to the primary  authority i.e., 1st respondent to re-consider the case of the petitioner\nand after affording a personal hearing to him, pass an appropriate order  in accord ance with law expeditiously\nbut not later than two weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order .\n7.

This writ petition under Article 226 of Constitution of India has been filed for the following relief:\n\"pleased to issue an appropriate writ, order or direction, more in the nature of Writ of Mandamus, setting\naside the common orders under DIN: 3703082343770 dated 3-8-2023 passed by the Deputy Assistant\nCommissioner of State T ax, Gollapudi Circle, V ijayawada and to pass such other order or orders.\"\n3. Chal lenge is to the order dated 3-8-202 3 passed under Section 74 of Goods and Services Tax Act (for short\n'GST Act').\n4. Preliminary objection has been raised that the order is appealable under the GST Act. Consequently , the\nwrit petition deserved not to be entertained.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute that the order is appealabl e under section 107 of GST\nAct but he submits that there is violation  of the principles of natural justice, and as such this petition deserves\nto be entertained. He submits that in the show cause notice dated 27-5-2023, there is mention that the letterAJAYwas sent to NAHI  vide reference 6th cited i.e., dated 14-3-2023 for passing of tollgate data and pursuant\nthereto the data was received from them. He submits that the same is the basis  of the show-cause notice and\nfor passing the impu gned order but the report or the information so received from NAHI was not supplied to\nthe petitioner .\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner furth er submits that there is violation of principles of natural justice at\nthe stage of providing personal hearing as well, in as much as firstly the notice for personal hearing dated 12-\n7-2023 fixing the date 17-7-2023 was served on 17-7-2023 i.e., the date of personal hearing. Consequently ,\nthe petitioner could not appear on that date. Secondly , the respondent issued another notice dated 21-7-2023\nfor personal hearing fixing the date 24-7-2023, but the petitioner could not appear for the reason that 22-7-\n2023 and 23-7-2023 were Saturday and Sunday and the time was not suf ficient to make personal appearance.\n7. In respon se, Sri T.C.D.Sekhar , learne d Government Pleader submits that details of date received from\nNAHI were disclosed in the show-cause  notice itself, at page No. 69. He submits that even if the copy of the\ninformation received from NAHI, might not have been provided, but, since the contents thereof were\ndisclosed in the show-cause notice itself, there is no violation of the principles of natural justice.\n8. Sri T.C.D.Sekhar , learned Government  Pleader further submits with respect to the personal hearing, that\ninspite of the second notice for personal hearing on 21-7-2023 by which 24-7-2023 was fixed, the petitioner\ndid not appear , though the petitioner is at Vijayawada and the place for personal hearing was also at\nVijayawada. There is no valid justification for not availing the opportunity of the personal hearing.\n9. Consideri ng the aforesaid submissions,  we find that even if the copy of the information received was not\nsupplied but the contents thereof were disclosed in the show-cause notice, there would be no violation of the\nprinciples of natural justice as the material was disclosed to the petitioner . The petitioner had also submitted\nthe reply to the show-cause notice on 7-7-2023. On consideration of the petitioner's reply , the impugned order\nwas passed.\n10. So far as the submission with respect to the violation of principles of natural justice of providing\nopportunity of personal hearing is concerned, the notice dated 21-7-2023 was given to the petitioner fixing the\ndate 24-7- 2023(Monday). It could not be demonstrated before us as to why the petitioner did not appear on\nthe date fixed. The explanation of Saturday and Sunday is not for the date fixed. We find that the petitioner\nhad no justifiable reason for not appearing for personal hearing on the date fixed. If a person does not avail the\nopportunity of personal hearing, he cannot later on complain about the same. On this aspect also we find that\nthere is no violation of principles of natural justice.\n11. The petitioner has got the statutory alternative remedy of appeal. If so advised, the petitioner can seek such\nalternative remedy in accordance with law .\n12. The writ petition is dismissed on the aforesaid ground.\nNo orders as to costs.\nAs a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, shall also stand closed."}

On 02.04.2024, the Court passed the following order:-\"Heard Sri S. Vivek Chandra Sekhar , learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri T. C. D. Sekhar , learned\nGovernment Pleader for Commercial Tax appears for the respondent Nos.2 and 3 and Sri Josyula\nBhaskara Rao, learned Central Government counsel appears for the respondent No.1.\n2. A preliminary objection has been raised by learned Government Pleader for Commercial Tax that the\npetitioner has got the statutory alternative remedy of appeal and as such the writ petition deserves not to\nbe entertained.\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute that there is remedy of appeal, but submits that the\nchallenge to the impugned order is on the grounds that, there is violation of the provisions of the GST;\nthe Assess ing Autho rity has failed to correctly apply the clarification circular dated 17.07.2023; and that\nthe petitioner is legally not under liability to pay any tax, but if the petitione r is relegated to file the\nappeal, he has to comply the statutory requirement of pre-deposit of 10% of the disputed amount under\nthe impugned order .\n4. From the aforesa id submissions, it is evident that there is no challenge on the ground of violation of\nprinciples of natural justice, or the order being without jurisdiction. There is also no challenge to the vires\nof any provision of the statute. In view thereof, we are of the view that the present case does not fall\nwithin the well-recognised exceptions, where the writ petition may be entertained, without relegating the\npetitioner to first avail the statutory alternative remedy of appeal and particularly when such ar guments or\nground of challenge, as raised before us, can be very well taken before the appellate authority . The\ncondition of pre-deposit for filing the appeal cannot be permitted to be bye-passed, by entertaining the\nwrit petition.\n5. At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner prays for time to further addre ss the Court on the above\naspect of alternative remedy and entertainability of the writ petition by placing some judgments.\n6. As requested, list on 23.04.2024.\n7. The above view expressed by us is only prima facie.\"\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has only reiterated the submissions which were advanced on 02.04.2024\nas quoted above.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the question involved is whether the circular dated\n17.07.2023 would or would not apply to the petitioner's case. In his submission the impugned order is\ncontrary to the circu lar dated 17.07.2023, though he submits that the said clarificatory circular , clarifies the\nissue of the determin ation of value of services provided by the Head offices of distinct persons to their Branch\noffices, but the same  would also be applicable to the petitioner's case which is that, the petitioner's unit - 1 at\nTelangana is eligible for full Input Tax Credit (ITC) of the GST on the job work manufacturing service it\nreceived from the petitioner unit - 2 at Andhra Pradesh. So the petitioner's case is of the service provided by\none unit to another unit and not by Head Of fice to Branch Of fice.\n6. Sri Josyu la Bhaska ra Rao, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 submits that the circular is very clear\nand does not apply to the petitioner's case.\n7. The respondent No.3 in its order considered the circular dated 17.07.2023 and observed as under:-\n\"Further , that the above clarification was issued by the CBIC to restrict the difficulties in distribution of\nInput Service Distribution, in general most of the services are being rendered from their Head Office and\nwill be distributed to the Branch Offices in order to reduce the complication in such distribution, the\nclarification was issued.\nIn view of the above clarification, it is obvious that the clarification shall be applicable to the transactions\nmade from Head Office to Branch Office only, but does not applicable to the services rendered from\nBranch Office to their Head Office. In the instant case, the services have been rendered from their Branch\nOffice at Pydibheem avaram to their Head Office at Hyderabad and thus the clarification is not applicable\nto the instant case.\"\n8. There is no challenge to the circular dated 17.07.2023 (P2) on the subject of \"clarification regarding\ntaxability of services provided by an office of an organization in one state to the office of that organization in\nanother state being district persons\".9. In any case, we are of the view that the aforesaid aspect of applicability of Circular dated 17.07.2023 to the\npetitioner's case, can be looked into by the Appellate Authority if such a plea is raised before the Appellate\nAuthority . It is not such a ground which cannot be taken in appeal.\n10. Any plea of the order being without jurisdiction, or in violation of the princip les of natural justice or in\nviolation of the Fundamental Rights has not been raised before us during arguments. There is also no\nchallenge to the vires of any statutory provisions.\n11. Any judgment on the point has not been placed before us to take a view contrary to the prima facie  view\ntaken in the order dated 02.04.2024 on entertainability of the writ petition in the presence of statutory\nalternative remedy of appeal.\n12. Cons equently , leaving it open to the petitioner to file the statutory appeal against the impugned order , if so\nadvised, as per law , we are not inclined to entertain the writ petition.\n13. Since we are relegating the petitioner to avail the alternative remedy of appeal, we are not observing\nanything with respect to the applicability or otherwise of the circular to the case of the petitioner .\n14. The writ petition is dismissed only on the ground of availability of the statutory alternative remedy .\n15. No order as to costs.\n16.

However , the GST rate on all\nforms of dried mangoes (other than sliced and dried mangoes), falling under heading 0804, including\nmango pulp, was always meant to be at the rate of 12%.\n4.3 Accordingly , it is hereby clarified that mangoes, fresh falling under heading 0804 are exempt;\nMangoes, sliced and dried, falling under 0804 are chargeable to a concessional rate of 5%; while all other\nforms of dried mang o, including Mango pulp, attract GST at the rate of 12%. To bring absolute clarity ,\nthe relevant entry at S. No. 16 of Schedule-II of notification no. 1/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28th\nJune, 2017, has been amended  vide notification No. 6/2022-Central T ax (Rate), dated the 13th July , 2022.\n4.4 Fresh mangoes, falling under heading 0804, continue to remain exempt from GST (S. No. 51 of\nnotification No. 2/2017-Central T ax (Rate), dated the 28th June, 2017].\"\n7. From a reading of the above, it is very clear now that on the basis of recommen dation of GST Council in its\n22nd meet ing, the GST rate on 'Mangoes sliced, dried' falling under heading 0804 was reduced from 12% to\n5% while GST rate on all forms of dried mangoes (other than sliced and dried mangoes) falling under heading\n0804, including mango pulp, was alway s meant to be at the rate of 12%. There fore, the petitioner is liable to\npay GST on Mango pulp @ 12%.\n8. In view of the above, orders passed by the Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling imposing GST in\nrespect of 'mango pulp' @ 18% is incorrect and it is made clear that the petitioner is liable to pay GST in\nrespect of Mango pulp @ 12%.\n9. Accordingly , the W rit Petition is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any , in this W rit Petition shall stand closed.*In favour of assessee."}

Ram achandra Rao, J. - The petitioner is engaged in the business of manufacture and sales of tractors\nand their spares. Its Corporate Of fice is located in T amil Nadu State and it has got Depots at dif ferent places in\nthe country .\n2. Regi stration certificate issued to the petitioner by the State of Telangana shows that its principal place of\nbusiness is Hayathnagar and it has also additional place of business at Bongulur village, Ibrahimpatnam\nMandal.\n3. The petitioner dispatched 4 tractors to its Depot at Hyderabad under consignment dated 3-3-2020 and also\nissued e-way bill bearing No. 541 172396402 on the same  day. The name of the consignor and consignee is the\nsame  and the address of the consignee is shown at Hayathnagar .\n4. The 3rd respondent, however , detained  the lorry bearing No. TN52W9857 on 5-3-2020 at 8.20 a.m. on the\nground that there was mismatch between the goods in movement and documents tendered and that there is\nalso mismatch between e-way bill and goods in movement. He also endorsed in the order of detention that thegoods were being transported from Ranipet, Tamil Nadu to Bongulur village, Ibrahimpatnam Mandal,\nHyderabad, but as per e-way bill, the goods have to be transported from Ranipet, State of Tamil Nadu to\nHayathnagar in the State of T elangana and so there is mismatch with the invoice and e-way bill.\n5. The 3rd respondent  then issued a show cause notice dated 5-3-2000 under section 129(3) of the CGST Act,\n2017 and TSGST Act, 2017 calling upon the petitioner to show cause within seven days why the proposed tax\nand penalty should not be payable. The tax proposed was Rs. 1,67,612/- towards CGST and equal amount\ntowards State GST along with equal penalty , totaling to Rs. 6,70,448/-.\n6. Being under the apprehension that the goods would be confiscated and there would be arrest of the\nCompany's officials under the Act, the petitioner paid the said amount and got the detained goods released on\n5-3-2000 by paying Rs. 6,17,448/-.\n7. Petitioner then filed this Writ Petition contending that the detention of the goods and recovery of GST and\npenalty by 3rd respondent is unsustainable and illegal.\n8. According to the petitioner , there was only a stock transfer from it's factory in Ranipet in the State of Tamil\nNadu to its Depot at Bongulur village, Ibrahimpatnam Mandal in the State of Telangana, that there is no\nelement of sale of goods or services in it, and mere transfer of goods inter-State would not attract the\nprovisions of the Act because there is no taxable event in it.\n9. It is contended that the deviation pointed by the 3rd respondent in the deten tion order is unsustainable\nbecause the GST registration of the petitioner in the State of Telangana itself shows its principal place of\nbusiness at Hayathnagar and additional place at Bongulur village, Ibrahimpatn am Mandal and therefore the\n3rd respondent acted illegally in recov ering tax and penalty from the petitioner by detaining the goods\nreferred to above.\n10. The 3rd responden t filed counter stating that he was not aware that the petitioner had got depots at\ndifferent places in the country . He also stated that it was not reflected in the invoice or the e-way bill. He\ncontended that when he issued show cause notice, the petitioner did not avail of the opportunity of responding\nto the show cause notice, and immediately paid the entire assessment and penalty without any objection and\nso the Writ Petition ought not to have entertained and it is an abuse of process of Court. He alleged that unlike\nVAT regime Branch transfer is taxable under the GST Regime, though he did not quote any provision of law\nin respect of the said plea.\n11. A reading of the counter -affidavit indicates that 3rd respondent does not dispute that petitioner's\nregistration certificate in the State of Telangana itself would disclose that its principal place of business is\nHayathnagar and its additional place of business is at Bongulur village, Ibrahimpatnam Mandal. The 3rd\nrespondent could have simply verified this fact in GST portal of the Government of India .\n12. We do not accep t the plea of the respondents that at the time of detention of the goods, the\ntransporter/driver of vehicle did not tell them that at Bongulur village, Ibrahim patnam Mandal, the petitioner\nhas an additional place of business. No reasonable person when asked to pay GST and penalty of more than\nRs. 6 lakhs, would keep quiet and meekly pay up without bringing the said facts  to the notice of the detaining\nauthority .\n13. The payment by the petitioner of the tax and penalty demanded by 3rd respon dent was obviously under\neconomic duress apprehending that the 3rd respondent was likely to confiscate the goods and arrest its\nofficials under the Act.\n14. Once it is clear that petitioner has additional place of business in the State of Telangana in Bongulur\nvillage, Ibrahimpatnam Mandal and the goods were being transported to that address from its Corporate office\nat Ranipet, Tamil Nadu State, it cannot be said that the petitioner was indulging in any illegal activity when\nthe tax invoice show s that the supplier is the petitioner's Corporate office in Ranipet, Tamil Nadu State and\nthat it was shipped to its Depot in Bongulur village in Ibrahimpatnam Mandal.\n15. Ther e was no occasion for the 3rd respondent to collect tax and penalty from the petitioner on the pretext\nthat there is illegalit y in the transport of goods as it would merely amount to stock transfer and there is no\nelement of sale of goods or services in it.\n16. In any event, now that 3rd respondent is made aware that petitioner has the principal Office at Tamil Nadu\nand principal place of business at Hayatnagar and additional place of business at Bongulur village,KAR TIKIbrahimpatnam Mandal, the tax and penalty collected from the petitioner cannot be allowed to be retained by\nrespondents.\n17. Accordingly , the Writ Petition is allowed; and respondents are directed to refund within four (04) weeks\nthe sum of Rs. 6,70,448/- collected towards CGST and State GST and penalty from the petitioner with interest\n@ 9% p.a. from 5-03-2020 till date of payment to petitioner by the respondents.  The 3rd respondent shall also\npay costs of Rs. 1,500/- (Rupees One Thousand and Five Hundred only) to the petitioner .\n18. Consequently , miscellaneous petitions, pending if any , shall stand closed.\n* In favour of assessee."}

As seen from the record, a show cause  notice was issued on 17-5-2022 informing the petitioner about the\ncancellation of the GST registration due to non-compliance of certain provisions in the GST Act or the Rules\nmade there under . Later on, another show cause notice, dated 27-5-2022, came to be issued, which indicates\nthat the petitioner has submitted some fake Input Tax Credit invoices claiming benefit. The said show cause\nnotices came to be challenged on the ground that the material on which reliance was placed for issuing the\nshow cause notices or for passing the order impugned was not furnished to the petitioner . It is urged that the\nfirst show cause notice does not contain the provisions of the GST Act which were said to have been violated.\nHowever , explanations to the said show cause notices were submitted and order impugned came to be passed\ncancelling the registration, relying on certain documents which were also not supplied to the petitioner .\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner mainly submits that there is no evidence to show that the material, which\nwas alleged to have been enclosed along with the show cause notices, was the material which was relied upon\nby the authority while passing the order and since the order does not indicate the material relied upon, pleads\nquashing of the same.\n5. However , the learned Government Pleader for Commercial Taxes opposed the same contending that the\nmaterial supplied to the petitioner was relied upon and as such, there is no illegality or incorrectness in the\norder impugned.\n6. A perusal of the show cause notice dated 27-5-2022, goes to show that as the petitioner herein has not\ncomplied with specified provisions of GST Act or the Rules made there under , he was asked to submit his\nexplanation within a period of seven working days from the date of service of the said notice. One fact which\nis required to be noted here is that the said show cause notice does not contain the provisions of law alleged to\nhave been violated by the petitioner .\n7. During the course of hearing, learned  Government Pleader placed on record another show cause notice\ndated 27-5-2022. The said show cause notice contain facts which are reflected in the earlier show cause\nnotice. The said show cause notice refers to fake invoices obtained from vario us non existent/dummy firms\nfor availing benefit of ineligible Input Tax Credits. But, however , learned coun sel for the petitioner submits\nthat the said show cause notice was not served on the petitioner and as such, he could not respond to the\ncontents of the said show cause notice, which appears to have been made, the basis to pass the impugned\norder .\n8. Having regard to the facts in issue; as the first notice issued is bereft of provisio ns of law, which are alleged\nto have been violate d; and as the second notice, which was issued on the very same day, contains details, to\nwhich no opportunity was given to the petitioner to submit his explanation, this Court is of the opinion that\nthe order under challenge is liable to be set aside and the matter be remanded to the 3rd respondent.\n9. Hence, the Writ Petition is allowed setting aside the order under challenge, dated 6-7-2022 and the matter is\nremanded back to the 3rd respondent, who shall issue a fresh notice, giving sufficient time to the petitioner for\nresponding to the same and thereafter , pass orders in accordance with law . There shall be no order as to costs.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending, if any, in this Writ Petition shall stand closed.\n* Partly in favour of assessee."}
